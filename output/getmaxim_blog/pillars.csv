Introduction
At the heart of reliable AI agents lies one critical skill: effective tool calling. We can see this in action with systems like the new Kimi K2, which connects seamlessly to dozens of tools, including web search, map navigation, financial analysis, and automated workflows. This results in impressive versatility and great tool call accuracy. In today‚Äôs era of the MCP, the ability for models to select and opera"
