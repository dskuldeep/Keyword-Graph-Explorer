Technical deep dive inspired by Anthropic’s “Building Effective Agents”
In this piece, we’ll take a close look at the orchestrator–worker agent workflow. We’ll unpack its challenges and nuances, then compare how leading frameworks – Agno, Autogen, CrewAI, OpenAI, LangGraph, and Mastra – approach and implement this pattern.

The difference between an effective and ineffective prompt can determine whether a model produces accurate responses or fails to generalize to new inputs.
Prompt optimization is the process of refining prompts to improve model outputs. This can involve adjusting wording, structuring inputs differently, or using more advanced techniques such as meta prompting and gradient-based optimization. While "

Claude Code is excellent for code generation and analysis. Once it lands in a real workflow, though, you immediately need visibility:
- Which tools are being called, and how reliably?
- How long do requests take end-to-end versus pure model latency?
- Where are prompts ballooning token counts (and cost)?
- How often do tool calls fail, and why?
Conventional logs often fall short here "

Our notebook provides an easy way to test out these evaluations for yourself.
Why Annotations Matter In AI
Annotations, specifically human annotations, provide high-quality feedback on how your agent or AI system is performing. Unlike automated methods, human annotations are precise. But, they’re also ti"

In this blog, I’ll break down what memory really means, how it relates to state management, and how different approaches—like session-based memory versus long-term persistence—affect performance, cost, and user experience.
Defining “Memory”
The term “memory” is often used in discussions about LLM applications, but it’s an abstraction that can mean different things to different people. Broadly, memory refers to any mechanism b"
