A Comprehensive Guide for Modern AI Teams
Introduction
Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical discipline in the development and deployment of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agentic workflows. As organizations strive to build reliable, context-aware, and high-performing AI solutions, the importance of crafting, refining, and managing prompts cannot be overstated. This blog offers a deep dive into the principles, practices, and t"

Agent simulation is the practice of testing AI agents in controlled but realistic environments that mirror multi-turn user interactions, tool usage, and varied personas. The purpose is to reveal failure modes and measure end-to-end quality before and after release. This guide outlines core concepts, scenario design, metrics, and workflow integration, with references to public materials for verification.

AI systems have crossed the threshold from prototypes to production-critical infrastructure. Customer support bots resolve thousands of tickets. Document agents triage insurance claims. Voice agents interview candidates in real time. When these systems fail, it impacts user trust, revenue, brand, and compliance. AI observability is how you stay ahead of that risk.

Introduction
As artificial intelligence systems become more complex and increasingly agentic, the distinction between model evaluation and agent evaluation has become both critical and nuanced. While the evaluation of underlying models (such as large language models, LLMs) remains foundational, the rise of AI agents (autonomous entities capable of multi-step reasoning, tool usage, and interacting with diverse environm"

Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved over the past decade, with Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents now powering mission-critical applications across industries. Yet, as adoption accelerates, one persistent challenge continues to undermine trust and reliability: AI hallucinations. In 2025, hallucinations (instances where AI generates factually incorrect or misleading outputs)"
