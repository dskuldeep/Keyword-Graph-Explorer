We are seeing strong traction (see metrics below), thus it is the right time to grow the team to build out our backend systems, product, and how we communicate with developers.\nWe have raised a $4M seed round from Lightspeed, General Catalyst, Y Combinator and angels.

It's not only about licensing, but about building a community far bigger than any single company. We are building in public.\nHigh Trust / Extreme Autonomy\nWe own work end-to-end. Everyone runs their part of the product, including planning, design, implementation and support. We removed any bureaucracy trusting you to do the right thing.\nStrong In-Person Engineering\nThe things we build are complex and are moving really fast. We are playing to win. We believe this takes a level of communication that only in-person work can achieve.\nDeep Work\nWe have only 2 scheduled meetings per week: 15 min planning on Monday, 60 min demo on Friday. We collaborate where it makes sense, but we get impatient with time not shipping.\nAgency & Taste\nOn the team we care deeply about agency and taste. It's about knowing what good looks like and shipping improvements without needing permission.\nA-Team\nWe want to build a small group of high leverage individuals. Everyone on our team earns their spot. We strive to raise the bar with every addition. Many on the team have led companies/teams before but are excited about shipping as an IC.\nAI Native\nWe build tooling to enable the best product engineering teams. At the same time, we use LLMs to scale our work to the max. We generally try to go the extra mile in order to keep the team engineering-focused by automating most other business functions. Every member of the team has budget to spend on AI tooling to scale their work.\nPublic Metrics\nWork with us\nCurious to build with us?\nIf you are excited about delivering exceptional open-source

engineering platform (GitHub) that helps teams collaboratively debug, analyze, and iterate on their LLM applications. All platform features are natively integrated to accelerate the development workflow. Langfuse is open, self-hostable, and extensible (why langfuse?).\nObservability\n- Log traces\n- Lowest level transparency\n- Understand cost and latency\nPrompts\n- Version control and deploy\n- Collaborate on prompts\n- Test prompts and models\nEvaluation\n- Measure output quality\n- Monitor production health\n- Test changes in development\nPlatform\n- API-first architecture\n- Data exports to blob storage\n- Enterprise security and administration\nObservability\nObservability is essential for understanding and debugging LLM applications. Unlike traditional software, LLM applications involve complex, non-deterministic interactions that can be challenging to monitor and debug. Langfuse provides comprehensive tracing capabilities that help you understand exactly what\u2019s happening in your application.\n- Traces include all LLM and non-LLM calls, including retrieval, embedding, API calls, and more\n- Support for tracking multi-turn conversations as sessions and user tracking\n- Agents can be represented as graphs\n- Capture traces via our native SDKs for Python/JS, 50+ library/framework integrations, OpenTelemetry, or via an LLM Gateway such as LiteLLM\nWant to see an example? Play with the interactive demo.\nWant to learn more? Watch end-to-end walkthrough of Langfuse Observability and how to integrate it with your application.\nTraces allow you to track every LLM call and other relevant logic in your app.\nPrompt Management\nPrompt Management is critical in building effective LLM applications. Langfuse provides tools to help you manage, version, and optimize your prompts throughout the development lifecycle.\n- Get started with prompt management\n- Manage, version, and optimize your prompts throughout the development lifecycle\n- Test prompts interactively in the LLM Playground\n- Run Prompt Experiments against datasets to test new prompt versions directly within Langfuse\nWant to learn more? Watch end-to-end walkthrough of Langfuse Prompt Management and how to integrate it with your application.\nCreate a new prompt via UI, SDKs, or API.\nEvaluation\nEvaluation is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of your LLM applications. Langfuse provides flexible evaluation tools that adapt to your specific needs, whether you\u2019re testing in development or monitoring production performance.\n- Get started with different evaluation methods: LLM-as-a-judge, user feedback, manual labeling, or custom\n- Identify issues early by running evaluations on production traces\n- Create and manage Datasets for systematic testing in development that ensure your application performs reliably across different scenarios\nWant to learn more? Watch end-to-end walkthrough of Langfuse Evaluation and how to use it to improve your LLM application.\nPlot evaluation results in the Langfuse Dashboard.\nWhere to start?\nSetting up the full process of online tracing, prompt management, production evaluations to identify issues, and offline evaluations on datasets requires some time. This guide is meant to help you figure out what is most important for your use case.\nSimplified lifecycle from PoC to production:\nWhy Langfuse?\n- Open source: Fully open source with public API for custom integrations\n- Production optimized: Designed with minimal performance overhead\n- Best-in-class SDKs: Native SDKs for Python and JavaScript\n- Framework support: Integrated with popular frameworks like OpenAI SDK, LangChain, and LlamaIndex\n- Multi-modal: Support for tracing text, images and other modalities\n- Full platform: Suite of tools for the complete LLM application development lifecycle\nCommunity & Contact\nWe actively develop Langfuse in open source together with our community:\n- Contribute and vote on the Langfuse roadmap.\n- Ask questions on GitHub Discussions or private support channels.\n- Report bugs via GitHub Issues.\n- Chat with the community on Discord.\n- Why people choose Langfuse?\nLangfuse evolves quickly, check out the changelog for the latest updates.

Langfuse\nLooking for a managed solution? Consider Langfuse Cloud maintained by the Langfuse team.\nLangfuse is open source and can be self-hosted using Docker. This section contains guides for different deployment scenarios. Some add-on features require a license key.\nWhen self-hosting Langfuse, you run the same infrastructure that powers Langfuse Cloud. Read \u201cWhy Langfuse?\u201d to learn more about why this is important to us.\nDeployment Options\nLangfuse Cloud\nLangfuse Cloud is a fully managed version of Langfuse that is hosted and maintained by the Langfuse team. Generally, it is the easiest and fastest way to get started with Langfuse at affordable pricing.\nLow-scale deployments\nYou can run Langfuse on a VM or locally using Docker Compose. This is recommended for testing and low-scale deployments and lacks high-availability, scaling capabilities, and backup functionality.\nProduction-scale deployments\nFor production and high-availability deployments, we recommend one of the following options:\nArchitecture\nLangfuse only depends on open source components and can be deployed locally, on cloud infrastructure, or on-premises.\nLangfuse consists of two application containers, storage components, and an optional LLM API/Gateway.\n- Application Containers\n- Langfuse Web: The main web application serving the Langfuse UI and APIs.\n- Langfuse Worker: A worker that asynchronously processes events.\n- Storage Components:\n- Postgres: The main database for transactional workloads.\n- Clickhouse: High-performance OLAP database which stores traces, observations, and scores.\n- Redis/Valkey cache: A fast in-memory data structure store. Used for queue and cache operations.\n- S3/Blob Store: Object storage to persist all incoming events, multi-modal inputs, and large exports.\n- LLM API / Gateway: Some features depend on an external LLM API or gateway.\nLangfuse can be deployed within a VPC or on-premises in high-security environments. Internet access is optional. See networking documentation for more details.\nOptimized for performance, reliability, and uptime\nLangfuse self-hosted is optimized for production environments. It is the exact same codebase as Langfuse Cloud, just deployed on your own infrastructure. The Langfuse teams serves thousands of teams with Langfuse Cloud with high availability (status page) and performance.\nSome of the optimizations include:\n- Queued trace ingestion: All traces are received in batches by the Langfuse Web container and immediately written to S3. Only a reference is persisted in Redis for queueing. Afterwards, the Langfuse Worker will pick up the traces from S3 and ingest them into Clickhouse. This ensures that high spikes in request load do not lead to timeouts or errors constrained by the database.\n- Caching of API keys: API keys are cached in-memory in Redis. Thereby, the database is not hit on every API call and unauthorized requests can be rejected with very low resource usage.\n- Caching of prompts (SDKs and API): Even though prompts are cached client-side by the Langfuse SDKs and only revalidated in the background (docs), they need to be fetched from the Langfuse on first use. Thus, API response times are very important. Prompts are cached in a read-through cache in Redis. Thereby, hot prompts can be fetched from Langfuse without hitting a database.\n- OLAP database: All read-heavy analytical operations are offloaded to an OLAP database (Clickhouse) for fast query performance.\n- Multi-modal traces in S3: Multi-modal traces can include large videos or arbitrary files. To enable support for these, they are directly uploaded to S3/Blob Storage from the client SDKs. Learn more here.\n- Recoverability of events: All incoming tracing and evaluation events are persisted in S3/Blob Storage first. Only after successful processing, the events are written to the database. This ensures that even if the database is temporarily unavailable, the events are not lost and can be processed later.\n- Background migrations: Long-running migrations that are required by an upgrade but not blocking for regular operations are offloaded to a background job. This massively reduces the downtime during an upgrade.

End-to-End Walkthrough Videos, Agent Demo Project, and more.\nThis month, we\u2019ve shipped updates to improve tracing for complex agents, enhance team collaboration, and expanded the integration library. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new:\nNew Observation Types\nWe\u2019ve introduced new observation types to give you deeper insight into your agent\u2019s behavior. You can now semantically label spans as Agent, Tool, Chain, Retriever, Embedding, and Guardrail, making it easier to debug and analyze complex traces.\nFor most agent framework integrations, these types are detected automatically. You can also set them manually via the Langfuse Tracing SDKs.\nEnd-to-End Walkthrough Videos\nWe\u2019ve released many new capabilities over recent months. We recorded four new short videos covering observability, prompt management, and evaluation to help you get up to speed quickly. Go check them out!\nAgent Demo Project\nExperiment with our revamped interactive demo (langfuse.com/demo) that uses the Langfuse Docs MCP server to help with Langfuse questions. This demo uses the new observation types mentioned above.\nMore August Releases\n-\nAnnotation Queue Assignments: Assign team members to specific annotation queues to streamline your data labeling workflow.\n-\nFull-Text Search Across Dataset Items: Quickly find what you need with full-text search across all items in your datasets.\n-\nNew options in Playground: We\u2019ve added support for model parameters, e.g.\nreasoning_effort\n,service_tier\n-\nDocs available as Markdown (.md) endpoints: Use our documentation pages as context for your coding agents via new\n.md\nendpoints.\nNew Integrations\nWe\u2019re excited to welcome new partners to the Langfuse ecosystem:\n-\nTruefoundry: An enterprise-grade AI Gateway and control plane.\n-\nByteplus by Bytedance: A suite of AI-powered APIs and services.\n-\nKoog: A Kotlin-based framework for building and running AI agents.\n-\nShadeform: Deploy inference and training jobs to any cloud provider.\nCommunity Growth\nWe\u2019re excited that the Langfuse community has grown to over 15k stars on GitHub, and our SDKs were downloaded nearly 11.8 million times in July alone. A huge thank you to everyone who has supported us!\nUser Highlights\nSumUp: Learn how the global payments company rolled out AI-powered support for 4 million merchants across 35+ markets.", "links":

"title": "Error Analysis to Evaluate LLM Applications - Langfuse Blog", "text": "Error Analysis to Evaluate LLM Applications\nA practical guide to identifying, categorizing, and analyzing failure modes in LLM applications using Langfuse.\nTo improve your LLM app, you must understand how it fails. Aggregate metrics won\u2019t tell you if your system retrieves the wrong documents or if the model\u2019s tone alienates users. Error analysis provides this crucial context.\nThe framework in this guide is adapted from Hamel Husain\u2019s Eval FAQ.\nThis guide describes a four-step process to identify, categorize, and quantify your application\u2019s unique failure modes. The result is a specific evaluation framework that is far more useful than generic metrics:\n- Gather a diverse dataset of traces\n- Open code to surface failure patterns\n- Structure failure modes\n- Label and quantify\nI\u2019ll demonstrate this process using a demo chatbot in the Langfuse documentation that uses the Vercel AI SDK and has access to a RAG tool to retrieve documents from the Langfuse documentation. The demo chat app logs traces into the Langfuse demo project and has already answered 19k user queries in the past year.\nHere\u2019s the chat interface (you can find the demo chat app here):\n1. Gather a Diverse Dataset\nTo start our error analysis, we assemble a representative dataset of 50-100 traces produced by the demo chat app. The quality of your analysis depends on the diversity of this initial data.\nExisting Production Traces: If you already have real user traces, as in our example, create your dataset based on them. I recommend first manually clicking through your traces, focusing only on the user input, and adding a diverse set of traces to an annotation queue.\nYou can also query for traces with negative user feedback, long conversations, high latency, or specific user metadata. The goal is not a random sample, but a set that covers a wide range of user intents and potential edge cases.\nIn Langfuse, you can add traces to an annotation queue by clicking the \u201cAdd to Annotation Queue\u201d button:\nSynthetic Dataset: If you lack production data, generate a synthetic dataset covering anticipated user behaviors and potential failure points. We have a Python cookbook that shows how to do this here. Once created, add these traces to a Langfuse Annotation Queue. Note that the quality of your dataset matters a lot for the success of your error analysis; it needs to be diverse and representative of the real world.\nThe Annotation Queue we created will serve as your workspace for the analysis. For our demo chatbot, we selected 40 traces reflecting different user questions, from simple definitions to complex comparisons:\n2. Open Coding: Surface Failure Patterns\nIn the next step, we open our Annotation Queue and carefully review every trace and its associated tool use. The objective is to apply raw, descriptive labels without forcing them into predefined categories.\nFor each trace, assign two annotations:\n-\nA binary score: Pass or Fail. This forces a clear judgment call.\n-\nA free-text comment: Describe the first point of failure you observe. This process is called open coding, as we are not forcing any categories on the data.\nIf you have traces with multiple errors, focusing on the first failure is efficient. A single upstream error, like incorrect document retrieval, often causes multiple downstream issues. Fixing the root cause resolves them all. Your comment should be a raw observation, not a premature diagnosis.\nHere are some examples from our demo chat app:\n3. Structure Failure Modes\nAfter annotating all traces, the next step is to structure your free-text comments into a coherent taxonomy.\nExport your comments from the Langfuse annotation job (you can query your comments via the Langfuse API). You can use an LLM to perform an initial clustering of these notes into related themes. Review and manually refine the LLM\u2019s output to ensure the categories are distinct, comprehensive, and accurately reflect your application\u2019s specific issues.\nFor our docs chatbot, we used the following prompt on our exported annotations:\nYou are given a list of open-ended annotations describing failures of an LLM-powered assistant that answers questions about Langfuse. Organize these into a small set of coherent failure categories, grouping similar mistakes together. For each category, provide a concise descriptive title and a one-line definition. Only cluster based on the issues in the annotations\u2014do not invent new failure types.\nThis produced a clear taxonomy:\n4. Label and Quantify\nWith our error labels in place, we can now annotate our dataset with these failure modes.\nFirst, create a new Score configuration in Langfuse containing each failure mode as a boolean or categorical option. Then, re-annotate your dataset using this new, structured schema.\nThis labeled dataset allows you to use Langfuse analytics to pivot and aggregate the data. You can now answer critical questions like, \u201cWhat is our most frequent failure mode?\u201d For our demo chatbot, the analysis revealed that Context Retrieval Issues were the most common problem.\nHere are the results after labeling our dataset:\nCommon Pitfalls\n-\nGeneric Metrics: Avoid starting with off-the-shelf metrics like \u201cconciseness\u201d or \u201challucinations.\u201d Let your application\u2019s actual failures define your evaluation criteria.\n-\nOne-and-Done Analysis: Error analysis is not a static task. As your application and user behavior evolve, so will its failure modes. Make this process a recurring part of your development cycle.\nNext Steps\nThis error analysis produces a quantified, application-specific understanding of your primary issues. These insights provide a clear roadmap for targeted improvements, whether in your prompts, RAG pipeline, or model selection.\nThe structured failure modes you defined serve as the foundation for building automated evaluators, which can scale this analysis across your application. However, before setting up automated evaluators, ensure you first address the obvious issues encountered during the error analysis. You can typically go through multiple rounds of this process before reaching a plateau.\nIn the upcoming blog post, we will set up automated evaluators and use them to continuously improve our demo chatbot.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192 Langfuse TypeScript SDK v4 is here \u2192"}, {"href":

"Evaluating Model Performance Across Clouds\nThis guide shows you how to use an automated benchmarking script in Shadeform that will help you measure self-hosted model performance across clouds.\nWhile many AI startups have built their applications around closed source model APIs, a growing number are turning to self-hosted open source or custom models\u2014especially in sectors that handle sensitive data like healthcare and legal.\nSelf-hosted models allow companies to retain full control over their data and fully customize the model to their application, making it an attractive choice for both privacy and competitive edge.\nHow to Self-Host a Model\nWhen self-hosting, companies can either deploy the model in their own datacenter (if they have the capital), or (more commonly) deploy the model in the cloud.\nHowever, if you deploy in the cloud, how do you go about choosing which cloud is best for your deployment?\nMany will opt for a hyperscaler like AWS, GCP, or Azure, but will suffer higher prices.\nFor companies who are capital sensitive, running in one of the 50+ new dedicated AI clouds like Lambda Labs, Nebius, Crusoe, or others is an alternative.\nEvaluating Clouds for Self-Hosting\nWhen evaluating these new clouds, outside of pricing, we care most about how our model is going to perform for the end user once deployed\u2014latency, throughput, etc.\nThere are many factors that contribute, from GPU specs to storage and networking configurations. However, it\u2019s almost impossible to gauge model performance by looking at a cloud\u2019s stat sheet.\nThe only reliable way to determine how your deployment will perform is to test it yourself. Luckily, we\u2019ve put something together to make that process much simpler.\nShadeform x Langfuse: Automated Cross-Cloud Benchmarking\nShadeform teamed up with Langfuse to put together an automated benchmarking script that will help you easily measure self-hosted model performance across clouds.\nWith Shadeform\u2019s multi-cloud GPU marketplace and launch template feature, we can easily pre-load and deploy the script across multiple cloud environments to evaluate them.\nHere\u2019s how the script works:\n- Creates a local deployment of Langfuse inside the GPU instance.\n- Starts a vLLM server\u2013\u2013the current gold standard inference engine\u2013\u2013with a specified Hugging Face model.\n- Feeds a series of prompts to the model.\n- Langfuse traces each chat completion and records latency, tokens, and tokens/second.\nOnce the script completes, you\u2019ll be able to view the results from the Langfuse UI.\nGetting Started\nCreate a Shadeform account and go to the template\nIf you don\u2019t have one already, create a Shadeform account here.\nOnce you have an account and can access the platform, you can find the benchmarking template here.\nSave the benchmarking template as a copy to customize it\nBefore we begin, we\u2019ll want to save the template as a copy.\nTo do this, click \u201cSave as a Copy\u201d in the top right corner.\nYour copy of the template can be found in the \u201cTemplates\u201d tab on the navigation bar under \u201cMy Resources\u201d.\nCustomize your template\nTo customize your template, click on your copy of the template, and then click \u201cEdit\u201d in the top right corner.\nScroll down to the section titled \u201cEnvironment Variables\u201d.\nStart by replacing the HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN value with your own.\nNext, replace the MODEL_ID value with the id of the Hugging Face model you want to evaluate, e.g. deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1.\n(Optional) If you want to customize the batch of prompts used to benchmark the model, scroll down to the \u201cStartup Script\u201d section.\nFind the section of the script titled \u2014 BENCHMARKING SCRIPT SETUP \u2014. Here, you\u2019ll find a list of prompts that you can customize to your needs.\nWhen you finish configuring the script, click \u201cUpdate Template\u201d at the bottom.\nSelect a GPU instance from the cloud you want to evaluate\nClick \u201cCompute Marketplace\u201d on the navigation bar, scroll down, and filter the results by \u201cCloud\u201d.\nNext, find a GPU instance you want to test on (e.g. 8x H200) and click \u201cLaunch\u201d.\nDeploy the template and wait for the script to complete\nFind the field titled \u201cTemplate\u201d towards the top of the launch page and select your copy of the benchmarking template.\nOnce your configurations populate, click \u201cDeploy\u201d.\nThe script should take around 15-30 minutes to complete depending on the model and GPU(s) used. You can check the script\u2019s status by clicking on the \u201cRunning Instances\u201d tab on the navigation bar, clicking on the instance, and clicking \u201cLogs\u201d.\nYou should see the following message once everything has finished: \u201cBenchmarking complete, view the results at: <instance-ip>:3000\u201d\nAccess the Langfuse UI to see the benchmark results\nOnce the script has completed, go to <instance-ip>:3000 to view the results.\nWhen you get to the Langfuse UI, you\u2019ll be met with an authentication screen.\nA user is provisioned by default so you don\u2019t have to create a new user.\nUsername: [email protected]\nPassword: 12345678\nAlternatively, any user created will automatically bind to the default organization with the pre-configured benchmarking project.\nOnce you\u2019ve authenticated in the Langfuse UI, click \u201cGo to project\u201d under the project titled \u201cBenchmark Run 1\u201d.\nNext, click \u201cTracing > Traces\u201d on the left-hand navigation bar.\nHere, you will see a table with each trace labeled \u201cPrompt n\u201d based on the order of the list of prompts.\nThe table will show you the latency (time it took to generate), the total tokens used, as well as the tokens per second.\nClicking on a trace will show the details of each response.\n(Optional): Run additional tests\nIf you want to run additional benchmarks in the same session, you\u2019ll need to SSH into the instance.\nTo SSH, click on the instance in the \u201cRunning Instances\u201d tab.\nScrolling down, you\u2019ll find a \u201cGet Private Key\u201d button.\nClick this button and follow the instructions on screen.\nOnce you have successfully SSH\u2019d into the instance, you can copy the python benchmarking script from the template into a new .py file and edit as needed before running.\nRepeat steps 5 & 6 for the next cloud\nBecause you saved the template as a copy in step 2, it\u2019s ready to be deployed on any other cloud instance for evaluation.\nSimply repeat steps 5 & 6 for the next cloud you want to evaluate.\nSummary\nSelf-hosted models offer significant advantages over closed source API solutions, especially for companies handling sensitive data. But, choosing the right cloud to deploy your model in can be both time and resource intensive. This automated benchmarking script simplifies performance evaluation across cloud environments, enabling companies to confidently select the optimal deployment solution based on real-world metrics.",

July Update\nLangfuse July Update: Playground Side-by-Side Comparison, real-time alerts (Webhooks & Slack) for prompt changes, usage alerts on Langfuse Cloud, and one-click remote experiments for non-technical teammates.\nWith Q3 in full swing, we\u2019ve shipped product updates to speed up your development: Side\u2011by\u2011side Playground testing, real\u2011time alerts (Webhooks & Slack) for prompt changes, usage alerts on Langfuse Cloud, and one\u2011click remote experiments for non\u2011technical teammates.\nQ3 Roadmap Highlights & Townhall\nEarlier this month, we held our Q3 planning and a community Townhall. Here are some of the highlights we will be working on in Q3:\n- Agent observability: unified agent graphs, richer tracing (tool\u2011call span types), built\u2011in agent evaluations across conversation/response/turn/trajectory.\n- Evaluation: rule\u2011based evaluators; LLM\u2011as\u2011judge at multiple levels with debugging & cost tracking; comparison dashboards (correlation, confusion matrix, overlap); SDK abstraction for dataset runs.\n- Data, prompts & platform: multimodal support for Datasets & Playground; I/O schema validation; tool/function support in Prompt Experiments; platform webhooks; in\u2011app routing.\n\u2192 View the public roadmap \u2192 Watch the Town Hall Recording\nPlayground Side-by-Side Comparison\nOpen multiple chat windows in parallel to compare prompts, models, variable inputs, or tools, and restore the test state.\nThis enables faster A/B testing, fewer open tabs, and shorter feedback cycles.\nSlack & Webhooks for Prompt Changes\nWe added Webhooks and a Slack integration to get real-time notifications for new prompt versions, changes to deployment labels or tags, and other edits.\nWe\u2019re expanding webhook triggers to cover more Langfuse events soon.\nTrigger Remote Custom Experiments\nYou can now trigger external Dataset Runs directly from the Langfuse UI. This feature enables non-technical users to run tests on Datasets without requiring code changes or manual setup.\n\u2192 Trigger a remote Dataset Run\nNew docs and integration pages\nWe reorganized our docs and integration guides to make discovery easier across observability, prompts, and evals.\n\u2192 Explore our new documentation and integration pages\nMore July Releases\n- Usage Alerts (Cloud): Set a threshold for monthly events; we\u2019ll notify you once per billing cycle when you cross it.\n- Sessions in the Annotation Queue: Integrate Sessions into your human annotation workflow.\n- n8n Node: Fetch Prompts from Langfuse Prompt Management into your n8n workflow.\n- Prompt Full-Text Search: Search through all your prompts to help find and organize large prompt collections.\n- LiveKit Integration: Trace your LiveKit agents to see latencies, costs and use it together with other Langfuse features.", "links": [{"href":

June Update\nLangfuse June Update: Lower prices across every Cloud plan, long-awaited features, team growth & more!\nJune was busy at Langfuse: We lowered prices across every Cloud plan thanks to some infrastructure improvements (we\u2019re excited to share these economies of scale with you), added several highly requested features to the new Dashboards and Prompt Management, and made onboarding even faster.\nMissed it? Langfuse Python SDK v3 is now generally available and ready for production use (upgrade guide).\n\ud83d\udcb8 Prices down on every Langfuse Cloud plan\nWe\u2019ve reduced usage-based pricing across the board and introduced automatic volume discounts on tracing units. You save more as you grow; no action needed.\n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u2642\ufe0f Pivot Tables in Custom Dashboards\nBig upgrade to custom dashboards in Langfuse. The new pivot table widget lets you analyze multi-dimensional data, making it easier to uncover patterns and insights across different segments and metrics.\n\u2192 See changelog\nBy the way, we have also added histograms to help you plot the distribution of metrics.\n\ud83e\udde9 Message placeholders in prompts\nThis is a much-requested improvement to Prompt Management that allows you to insert arrays of messages at any point within a Langfuse chat prompt. It is fully compatible with Langfuse Prompt Experiments and Playground.\n\ud83d\udcc2 Organize prompts with folders\nKeep your prompt library tidy by adding folders directly in the prompt name:\nproduction/email_welcome\nAnything before the \u201d/\u201d becomes a folder. Organize by use-case, model, or team\u2014no more endless scroll.\n\ud83e\udd16 Agentic Onboarding (Beta)\nAdd Langfuse to agents like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf via our new MPC endpoint. It\u2019s experimental, and we\u2019d love your feedback.\n\u2795 More June Releases\n- Histogram charts in custom dashboards\n- Export dataset items via the UI\n- Download aggregated stats directly

Open Source - Langfuse Blog", "text": "Doubling Down on Open Source\nToday we are open sourcing all remaining Product Features in Langfuse under the MIT license\nThe LLM landscape is changing rapidly and so are the workflows used to build and improve LLM apps. Today, we are open sourcing all Product Features in Langfuse to enable our community to iterate on their applications faster and provide our project with feedback on where to go next.\nNewly open sourced features include managed LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, annotation queues, prompt experiments and the playground, all of which are now freely available to self-host under the MIT license.\nIf you are self-hosting Langfuse already today, upgrade your deployment to the latest version. You will find a more powerful version of Langfuse.\nWhy are we doing this?\nLangfuse is building the open source LLM Engineering Platform. We are building the platform to observe and improve LLM applications.\nWe are constantly shipping to be the technology of choice for our community. This requires trust, feedback and buy-in from our community.\nWe re-visited the gated features in our Enterprise Edition. If we want to be the first choice in the market, we need to allow our community to cover the entire dev cycle in our FOSS version. Features like LLM-as-a-Judge, Evals, or our Playground are market standard at this point and should be freely available. But why stop there?\nThe best platform for developers has to be open at its core. By removing commercial barriers from our product features, we\u2019re fostering deeper trust, collaborating on contributions, accelerating adoption, gathering richer community feedback, and iterating faster than ever.\nOur Open Source Journey\nLangfuse was launched as an open source project. This was based on a few core beliefs:\n- Data captured by Langfuse should be freely accessible\n- The AI landscape changes every week \u2013 Langfuse must integrate agnostically with all models and application stacks\n- Great teams deserve the flexibility to extend the platform to support custom workflows\nThis positioning resonates and today we are doubling down on it.\nLangfuse has been an open core company from the start. Our core just expanded significantly and our periphery shrunk. Commercially licensed code is now limited to features for Enterprise Security and Platform Teams (e.g. SCIM, Audit Logs, Data Retention Policies \u2013 regular SSO is and continues to be MIT licensed).\nLangfuse\u2019s Open Core Model\nAs we open source previously commercial features, we are fully investing our commercial focus in Langfuse Cloud and Enterprise platform teams in self-hosting.\nThousands of Langfuse Deployments\nBesides >7,000,000 monthly SDK installs and >5,500,000 Docker pulls, there are >8,000 monthly active self-hosted instances of Langfuse out in the wild. This boggles our minds.\nWe expect that today\u2019s changes solidify Langfuse as the first choice for a powerful and truly open source platform in LLMOps.\nToday is the day to start self-hosting Langfuse. Head over to our self hosting docs and use the new terraform modules for deploying Langfuse at production-scale.\nSome additional public metrics:", "links": [{"href":

Langfuse Blog", "text": "How we Built Scalable & Customizable Dashboards\nA technical deep dive into the core abstractions and architecture\nOn Day 3 of Langfuse Launch Week 3, we introduce customizable dashboards (docs): a powerful way to visualize LLM usage directly within the Langfuse UI. Whether you want to track latency trends, monitor user feedback, or correlate cost with performance, our new dashboards let you build the charts you need - right where you need them. And for those who prefer working in their own analytics stack, we\u2019ve made the same querying capabilities available via our API (docs).\nFor context: quick demo of the finished product\nIn this post, I\u2019ll take you behind the scenes: from our product thinking to the technical implementation, testing, and rollout\u2014and share the lessons we learned in building flexible, real-time insights into your LLM pipelines.\nMotivation\nCustomizable dashboards were among the most requested features within Langfuse. Early on, we had the home screen dashboard that showed users metrics we believed to be relevant and accurate. We expanded that over time based on feedback about the charts users wanted to see. The dashboard grew quite long, and we found that charts were relevant but not necessarily to the same kind of users. A product manager wants to understand which score specific traces receive, while a developer wants to see latencies, error rates, and costs.\nWe realized that we needed to provide dashboards that were adaptable to the needs of different users and personas. This involved the ability to create multiple dashboards, a variety of charts and insights, and a flexible query engine. While exploring custom dashboards, we found that within our data model and constraints, this would become quite complex.\nTherefore, we included custom dashboards as part of the Superday in our interview process and had many candidates design their version of the dashboard and share their thoughts. That\u2019s how this became the most specced feature we have ever had at Langfuse. Early in March, I set out to finally implement it and now, I\u2019ll take you on the journey showing how I completed the feature that we are launching today.\nArchitecture: Building for Flexibility, Performance, Maintainability\nDashboards are built on top of 3 major components:\n- Database/metrics Abstraction\n- Query Builder\n- Dashboard Builder\nLet\u2019s dive into each of these and show how we can use them to build the dashboards.\nArchitecture diagram\nDatabase Abstraction\nBefore we could start the dashboard, we had to decide how to abstract our data model. Directly exposing our database felt like the wrong move as this would lock us from updating the data model and may not fit the mental model of our customers. Therefore, we decided to build custom dashboards around the tracing data model.\nFor this purpose, we created a virtual data model that contains the full definition of what we expose. It is used to fill the frontend, including units and documentation, and also used for validations on the backend. Below, you can find an excerpt of the Trace definition.\nexport const traceView: ViewDeclarationType = {\nname: \"traces\",\ndescription:\n\"Traces represent a group of observations and typically represent a single request or operation.\",\ndimensions: {\nname: {\nsql: \"name\",\ntype: \"string\",\n// include documentation\ndescription:\n\"Name assigned to the trace (often the endpoint or operation).\",\n},\nuserId: {\nsql: \"user_id\",\nalias: \"userId\",\ntype: \"string\",\ndescription: \"Identifier of the user triggering the trace.\",\n},\n},\nmeasures: {\ncount: {\nsql: \"count(*)\", // measures can be columns or expressions\nalias: \"count\",\ntype: \"integer\",\ndescription: \"Total number of traces.\",\nunit: \"traces\", // units used for charts and documentation\n},\nlatency: {\nsql: \"date_diff('millisecond', min(observations.start_time), max(observations.end_time))\",\nalias: \"latency\",\ntype: \"integer\",\nrelationTable: \"observations\", // indicates that join is needed\ndescription:\n\"Elapsed time between the first and last observation inside the trace.\",\nunit: \"millisecond\",\n},\n},\ntableRelations: {\nobservations: {\nname: \"observations\",\njoinConditionSql:\n\"ON traces.id = observations.trace_id AND traces.project_id = observations.project_id\",\ntimeDimension: \"start_time\", // all tables are filtered by time for performance\n},\n},\nsegments: [],\ntimeDimension: \"timestamp\",\nbaseCte: `traces FINAL`,\n};\nThis declarative definition helps us to decouple the database from the request schema and enables us to quickly define new measures and dimensions.\nQuery Builder\nThe hardest challenge around the dashboards, and something we knew right away, was getting the query builder right. I think representing dashboard configurations within the database is a solved problem, as is having charts on the front end that render nicely, are responsive, and look good on different screens (s/o to all the great libraries for this).\nWe introduced ClickHouse back in November of last year, and this was the first unlock we needed to get this done (learn more about this change in our v3 infra blog post). The second challenge was figuring out the data model and how to generate queries reliably while staying flexible.\nWithin our data model, we often see that observations need to be aggregated at the trace, user, or session level. In the typical OLAP cube model - common across visualization tools - those multi-level aggregations are not natively supported or are complex to define.\nIn addition, the dashboard must be responsive, and look good on all screens and devices. We need a good data model to represent the individual charts and the overall dashboard, making a good trade-off between reuse and understandability of how things work.\nLangfuse is developing rapidly, so we need to ensure that the created dashboards are decoupled from the data model. This will prevent the charts from breaking as we modify the underlying data layer.\nWith those constraints in mind, the challenge was to accept a flexible, domain-specific JSON and translate it. We thought about how we would query this endpoint. The typical OLAP cube model came in really handy here, and we tried to stick to it as much as possible. We settled onto the following input format:\n{\n\"view\": string,\n\"dimensions\": [\n{\n\"field\": string\n}\n],\n\"metrics\": [\n{\n\"measure\": string,\n\"aggregation\": string\n}\n],\n\"filters\": [],\n\"timeDimension\": {\n\"granularity\": string\n},\n\"fromTimestamp\": string,\n\"toTimestamp\": string,\n\"orderBy\": []\n}\nAfter multiple iterations, we settled on a generic query pattern that pre-computes the necessary metrics at the entity level and then performs an additional set of aggregations on the entity to produce the final result. Schematically the query looks like this:\nSELECT\n<...dimensions>,\n<...metrics.map(metric => `${metric.aggregation}(${metric.alias})`>\nFROM (\nSELECT\n<baseCte>.project_id,\n<baseCte>.id\n<...dimensions.map(dimension => `any(${dimension.sql}) as ${dimension.alias}`>,\n<...metrics.map(metric => `${metric.sql} as ${metric.alias || metric.sql}`>\nFROM <baseCte>\n(...tableRelations.joinConditionSql)\nWHERE <...filters>\nGROUP BY <baseCte>.project_id, <baseCte>.id\n)\nGROUP BY <...dimensions>\nORDER BY <fields with directions>\nWithin our execution flow, we transformed the input in multiple steps to consistently arrive at the valid, final query.\nTo test this, we created our own query playground where you could input a JSON statement, and it would compile and execute a corresponding query. Using these features, we started to replace the queries we used for our legacy/static home screen dashboard to verify that the query builder was sufficiently flexible and performant.\nWe saw that the queries would execute at scale with a lot of flexibility. Given that we had already covered a lot of ground within those dashboards, seeing them run well and scale effectively even across longer time horizons gave us the confidence that we were on the right track and could proceed to build the remaining features. At this point, the power of ClickHouse came in really handy because initially, we optimized for development speed, focusing on understanding what is going on within the query builder.\nDashboard Builder\nIn addition, we had to decide whether we wanted to embed all the widgets within the dashboards, meaning that they only live and exist within the scope of a single dashboard, or if we wanted to allow some reuse between the widgets. We found that the reuse option seemed very tempting, as it allows you to have a single source of truth on charts. One expert could create a score and a corresponding score widget, which can then be reused across multiple dashboards. I have seen in the past, with many companies, that the replication of things across dashboards either led to a lack of maintenance where items would get out of date or where a misunderstanding of the metric created multiple widgets with separate meaning.\nmodel Dashboard {\nid String @id @default(cuid())\nname String @map(\"name\")\ndescription String @map(\"description\")\n// { \"widgets: [ {\"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"id\": \"cuid\", \"type\": \"widget\", \"x_size\": 6, \"y_size\": 6, \"widgetId\": \"cuid\"}, { ... } ] }\ndefinition Json @map(\"definition\")\n}\nmodel DashboardWidget {\nid String @id @default(cuid())\nname String @map(\"name\")\ndescription String @map(\"description\")\nview String @map(\"view\")\ndimensions Json @map(\"dimensions\")\nmetrics Json @map(\"metrics\")\nfilters Json @map(\"filters\")\nchartType String @map(\"chart_type\")\nchartConfig Json @map(\"chart_config\")\n}\nDelivery & Launch\nCreating the Beta\nBased on the specification we created above, we started vibe-coding an initial version of the feature. Tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf came in really handy in creating the necessary functionality. We had a clear idea of what the final query should look like, what the test cases should cover, and how the interface should be designed. In this situation, prompting works really well.\nOverall, this is something we frequently use here at Langfuse (see post on how we use LLMs). We understand the topic deeply, create a design or mental model of how it should work, and then have AI help us write the code for it. This approach allows our team of eight people to scale to tens of thousands of users and billions of events.\nOur next use of the AI agent was toward creating unit tests. Initially, we focused on creating valid queries. Then, we wanted to create correct queries, meaning that we created a known set of test data and validated that they produce the correct results. After that, we compared the results to our existing dashboard logic to reproduce our home dashboard functionality. Finally, we went deep on SQL injection tests to ensure that any variety of user inputs are caught and not forwarded to the database if the input might be malicious. This is fundamental for a feature like custom dashboards and a non-negotiable for us. If you want to see the total size of the tests we created, which are much larger than the feature overall, head over to our repo.\nOnce the backend powered our home dashboards, we began building the UI. Here, we reused as many fully functional libraries as possible, giving a shout-out to the shadcn/charts, Recharts, and React Grid Layout. We started with a basic prototype of how the widget builder can work - focusing on its responsiveness, rendering, and ensuring that a single component functions well and that users can understand the flow. From there, we explored how to render multiple components and how to save the configurations within the database.\nEven though I am historically more of a platform developer, it was easy enough to get into it and flesh this out end-to-end, and the reviews from the other maintainers helped me avoid the biggest mistakes. We see AI as a significant enabler for engineers to be faster and build more things across a wider domain (embrace end-to-end product engineering). However, we still recognize the need for human interaction and expert reviews to prevent creating excessive technical debt. It is always important to understand what you are doing and what is happening in order to keep the management model intact.\nTest and Launch\nWith this early version in place, we decided to create a beta release and share custom dashboards with our users on the cloud product. Why cloud only and not for self-hosted deployments, you may ask? Because here we were confident that we could still change the data model, the interface, and how we store dashboards, in the worst case, manually. We didn\u2019t want to risk users having to mutate data within Postgres and ClickHouse on their own if necessary.\nAfter seeing the data from the first week and confirming that the behavior worked well, we also pushed the release for our open-source self-hosters so they could get started building their dashboards.\nRight after the launch, feedback started coming in about which charts users wanted to see, what other functionality they wanted to use, and which parts of the dashboards were unintuitive. Fortunately for us, performance was rarely a concern. The focus was more on seeing more, visualizing more, and overall making the feature more complete.\nMany of the features that users wished for are included in today\u2019s release. These include:\n- Additional chart components.\n- Resizable and movable widgets within the dashboard screen.\n- The ability to rename components.\n- More tooling support when creating a new widget to reduce friction.\nIn addition, we are launching Langfuse-managed Dashboards, which consists of topic-focused dashboards that we believe are useful given the data users have. You can use them as they are and receive the latest updates with each new release, or clone them into your repository and modify them to your liking.\nTry it Today\nWe\u2019re excited to see what users will build using the new dashboarding functionality. In the coming days and weeks, we will release additional chart types, with tables and pivot tables high on our list. Please share any feedback you might have with us on GitHub. We will also continue adding improvements, more metrics, and more data to the dashboards. One likely candidate for future development is the experiments feature. This will allow you to observe your offline activities together with your online evaluations and cross-correlate the results. Stay tuned.\nDon\u2019t Miss Out\nWe are hiring\nWe are hiring in Berlin!

LLMs to build and scale Langfuse - Langfuse Blog", "text": "How we use LLMs to scale Langfuse\nBuilding a fast-growing open-source project with a small team is fun. These are some of the ways how we use LLMs to accelerate.\nAt Langfuse we\u2019ve built a culture of aggressively adopting AI tooling. Mostly because we really enjoy it, but also because we want to move fast with a lean/excellent team. As a result, friends often ask what AI tools and workflows work best for our team and for me personally.\nThis post summarizes what works best for me personally in a more exhaustive way than what I could ever share via a text message. My goal is to help others discover more applications of AI by highlighting specific workflows. This is very much inspired by Karpathy\u2019s video \u201cHow I use LLMs\u201d which was surprisingly useful to many people.\nBased on my experience, applying AI well is a combination of (1) becoming good at using tools like ChatGPT and Cursor and (2) adopting more specialized \u201cwrappers\u201d like Inkeep or Dosu that solve a specific use case way faster. I\u2019ll go deep on both aspects below.\nI want to learn from you! Please reach out if I\u2019m missing out on something that works really well for you.\nThis post is not covering how to build applications with LLMs/GenAI (the core focus of Langfuse). Please check out many of our posts on this if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\nEmail Management\nI thought Superhuman was for people that did not set up Gmail shortcuts, reply-all, archive and next, and multi-inboxes; I was wrong. I easily save multiple hours every week thanks to Superhuman.\nMy inbox is important but also a major source of frustration. I get to spend many hours per day on it and I need to be on top of it. Superhuman has been a lifesaver for smart follow-up suggestions, drafting quick responses, and good tab-autocomplete next to a very responsive UI, good keyboard shortcuts and slow-network performance. For example, while \u201csounds good\u201d might be the core message, it sometimes isn\u2019t formal enough for an email chain. Cmd + J\nhelps to make it a bit more context aware.\nGlobal Text Improvement\nI\u2019m a big Raycast fan overall, the global clipboard history alone would be worth tens of dollars a month if there was no free alternative.\nRaycast AI Chat (global chatgpt window that opens/closes with low latency) and AI Commands are really nice additions. The feature I use the most is a global keyboard shortcut to improve the writing of any text I\u2019ve selected; and press enter to replace the selected text with the improved version.\nIt is also easy to add own AI commands, I for example created one to group github release notes based on conventional-commit prefixes.\nWhen creating automations, I usually struggle with the \u201cpayback period\u201d. It often takes dozens of executions before they actually save time. With AI Commands, however, creating them is so easy and low-risk that they\u2019re worth it almost immediately.\nUsing ChatGPT well for research and writing\nChatGPT (and Claude et al.) are potentially the most versatile but also underutilized tools as it takes a while to learn how to use them well in daily routines.\nChatGPT Deep Research is worth every cent. Multiple times a week, I need to quickly get up to speed on topics I know little about. I think it is one of the most compelling AI applications that I have ever tried and very applicable to my daily work when building Langfuse. See for example this detailed analysis of the party programs ahead of the last general election in Germany.\nFor long-form writing, the release of o3 with tools (websearch and canvas) is huge. Managing the context well has the biggest impact on the quality of the output. My favorite workflows involve generating context in separate threads (to avoid polluting the main conversation) before copying it into a GPT-4o thread:\n- Deep research: Usually I record a 1-2 minute voice memo as an initial instruction for deep research. I try to be very specific about the chapters/sections that deep research should go deep on, and I encourage more depth.\n- Voice Mode for Brainstorming: I like to use ChatGPT voice mode as it helps to collect my own thoughts on a topic while walking or biking especially when I haven\u2019t made up my mind yet but have lots of thoughts. Sometimes the questions asked by it are helpful, but can also be ignored as the main point is the transcript of 10-20 minutes of thinking and talking aloud about a topic. For shorter input, the in-app speech-to-text is excellent, but it has failed on me multiple times, forcing me to re-record, which is frustrating. Voice mode seems more stable to me once it works.\nFor example, I gathered the initial ideas for this post during a 15-minute voice session. I then created a draft in O3 on Canvas based on the transcript. Afterward, I made significant edits in Cursor, but it was a great way to get started.\nProgramming Workflow in Cursor\nI use Cursor; I\u2019ve tried Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI and many alternatives but I prefer a GUI that (1) lets me @mention additional context easily, and (2) allows me to review changes while applying additional changes to other files at the same time.\nMy approach to reviewing large diffs involves reviewing changes as they are generated and staging what I like in Git. This approach provides a clear view of reviewed and unreviewed changes. Compared to reviewing the whole diff at once, it helps maintain my flow (no waiting for cursor to finish) and prevents the need to review thousands of lines at once.\nRecent realization. Always turn on MAX, it is only USD 0.05 / request and subjectively has a positive impact on results. Spending USD 10/h while programming in Cursor would be totally fine and it is difficult to even spend that much.\nCursor has a learning curve. I usually learn something when I watch someone else using Cursor. I believe that those that don\u2019t get value out of it, haven\u2019t observed someone who uses it well. These are my personal favorites to improve results (not an expert at this though as I only spend about 10-15h/week in Cursor):\n- @mention a documentation url\n- I use deep research when planning for a more complex technical change. The deep research output can be broken down with a reasoning model to get to stepwise instructions that I can copy to Cursor. Add deep research project plan to an .md file within the repo and mention it as high-level context for the current task.\n- When working on a linear ticket, I add a couple of notes regarding what I expect (e.g. \u201cadd public api, add to openapi spec, add e2e tests\u201d) and then copy the whole issue as markdown (cmd-k + \u201ccopy issue as markdown\u201d) and paste it into Cursor. This way, I have less risk of crafting prompts within Cursor that are lost when needing to reset the Cursor agent session.\n- @mention a PR or current diff with main branch. This especially helps when I created a new abstraction that I now want to use in other files as the diff is a great way to select just the important initial context for a prompt. Same applies when I need to do something similar over and over, often it is easier to implement the first diff myself and then ask Cursor Agent to apply the same change to all other occurrences (e.g., applying a rate limit key to each API route based on its type).\nDocumentation & Changelogs\nDocs are crucial and one of the main reasons Langfuse can scale to a large community. We maintain hundreds of pages of Langfuse documentation and changelogs (repo).\nIn the core writing flow, Cursor-tab helps expand them, while cmd-k\nhelps make them concise again (less is almost always better).\nRecently, I added more cursor rules to simplify prompting for new changelog posts and adding cross-references.\nAutomations and GitHub Actions are a great target for \u2018vibe-coding\u2019, they are at the edge of the application, very much standalone, and thus implementation details of a simple script don\u2019t matter too much. I recently added actions to:\n- generate an llms.txt (source)\n- check if all internal links actually work (source)\n- update the cross-reference cursor rule on a schedule (source)\n- mirror all Langfuse github discussions in a json in order to render them within the docs without a network call (source)\nThese automations dramatically increase the quality of our docs and took very little time to implement. If I had to build them myself, they wouldn\u2019t have been worth the time investment.\nAI-Assisted Code Reviews\nWe move fast as a team, thus AI-based PR reviews save us a lot of time. We tried Greptile and Ellipsis, both are really good. I think they are most helpful in two areas:\n-\nThey catch stupid issues ahead of a more formal review. Examples: comments that should not make it to main, or a setTimeout that was added to an api to test whether the frontend gracefully handles loading states, or a zod type that could be narrowed.\n-\nThey suggest performance and typing improvements, e.g. memoizing some react state. Usually these suggestions can easily be applied by copying the critique into the Cursor agent and directly pushing the change.\nIf you want to see more examples for this, check out the latest merged PRs in the main Langfuse repo.\nScaling Community Support\nSupporting a fast-growing open-source project (10 k GitHub stars and tens of thousands of teams) with a small core team is a good problem to have\u2014but it\u2019s still an effort that sometimes keeps us from shipping new features. We\u2019re a team of mostly engineers and everyone does support for their features. This is nice as it results in a very tight feedback loop and generally good documentation out of self-interest.\nTo reduce the manual support overhead (and help us provide high-quality support without burning out), we added three layers of AI-help for common questions that are already covered by the docs:\n- langfuse.com/ask-ai: The Inkeep widget sits on every docs page and answers about 2 k questions each week straight from our knowledge base.\n- Public Q&A in GitHub Discussions: We encourage community questions in Discussions because they\u2019re indexed by search engines. Dosu automatically drafts answers by combining our docs, previous issues, and earlier discussions, resolving many threads every week.\n- Private support channels: For shared Slack channels, website chat, and support@ emails, we route everything through Plain.com. Plain indexes the docs and github discussions and helps with in-flow AI drafts.\nExample: Dosu resolving a thread in GitHub Discussions\nThose are some of the highlights of how I\u2019m currently leveraging LLMs. As mentioned earlier, this is by no means an exhaustive list. If you have recommendations or experiences you\u2019d like to share, please reach out\u2014I\u2019d love to hear from you.\nIn my opinion, it is difficult to spend too much money on AI \u201cwrappers\u201d and tokens. They let teams stay small while shipping far more with less coordination overhead, fewer meetings, and clearer individual ownership.\nWe\u2019re all lucky to be building right now as we can assume that the quality of tooling will only improve over the next months/years. When something new, like Deep Research for example, comes out (even when it\u2019s USD200/month), it seems like a very good investment for me to try it.\nIf you\u2019re excited about working on oss

Blog", "text": "Langfuse March Update\nLangfuse March Update: New UI, Prompt Composability, Environments & More!\nWe\u2019ve been busy this month at Langfuse! From a fresh UI redesign to major feature rollouts, here\u2019s a summary of the highlights:\n\ud83d\udcab UI Redesign\nIn the last few weeks, we\u2019ve revamped the Trace and Prompt views. We love the new look as it makes the pages cleaner, simplifies navigation, includes more data, and speeds up navigation when going through a lot of data.\n\ud83e\udde9 Prompt Composability\nThis was one of the most requested features: you can now reuse prompts in other prompts, letting you organize prompts in a modular way.\nFor example, create a shared \u201cguidelines\u201d prompt and use it across all of your prompts. When guidelines are updated, all of your dependent prompts will be updated.\n\u2192 Check out the end-to-end demo here.\n\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Environments\nLangfuse is all about closing the loop between production and development to iterate quickly. That\u2019s why we introduced Environments, allowing you to separate environments (e.g. production, staging, dev) in Langfuse Tracing without needing to use tags or projects.\nThis enables you to share prompts, datasets, and more within a project without mixing the source of your tracing data.\n\u2192 Learn how to set this up in our docs.\n\u2795 More Features\n-\nOpenAI Responses API support in SDKs Trace OpenAI Responses API calls with our Python and JS SDKs\n-\nPublic API for Annotation Queues Access and manage annotation queues programmatically with our new endpoints.\n-\nLangfuse Java Client Langfuse offers a new Java API client for easy integration with Java applications.\n-\nBatch-export Scores via UI Evaluation scores can now be exported in bulk as CSV or JSON directly from the Langfuse UI for easier one-off analysis and reporting.\n-\nExport via Blob Storage Integration You can create scheduled exports to Blob Storage, e.g. S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage, for traces, observations, and scores. Thereby you can analyze and join the data in your own data warehouse.\n\ud83e\udd1d New Integrations\nThis month, we also added a couple of new integrations:\n\u2192 If there is an integration you would like to see, add it to our public roadmap on GitHub.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Langfuse Town Hall (April 9th)\nJoin us for our next Town Hall, where we will showcase live demos of the main Q1 releases and share a sneak peek at what\u2019s planned for Q2.\n\u2192 Sign up here.\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udcbb We\u2019re Hiring in Berlin\nLangfuse is growing fast! We\u2019re looking for talented individuals to join our Berlin team. If you or someone you know might be interested, check out our open positions.

"text": "Open-Source AI Agent Frameworks: Which One Is Right for You?\nExplore the leading open-source AI agent frameworks\u2014LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, Smolagents, CrewAI, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, LlamaIndex agents, Strands Agents, and Pydantic AI agents. Compare features, learn when to use each, and see how to track agent behavior with Langfuse\nBuilding AI agents used to be a patchwork of scripts, prompt engineering, and trial-and-error. Today, there is a growing landscape of open-source frameworks designed to streamline the process of creating agents that reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously. This post offers an in-depth look at some of the leading open-source AI agent frameworks out there: LangGraph, the OpenAI Agents SDK, Smolagents, CrewAI, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, LlamaIndex agents, Strands Agents, and Pydantic AI agents. By the time you finish reading, you should have a clearer view of each framework\u2019s sweet spot, how they differ, and where they excel in real-world development.\nOne of the biggest challenges in agent development is striking the right balance between giving the AI enough autonomy to handle tasks dynamically and maintaining enough structure for reliability. Each framework has its own philosophy, from explicit graph-based workflows to lightweight code-driven agents. We\u2019ll walk through their core ideas, trace how they might fit into your workflow, and examine how you can integrate them with monitoring solutions like Langfuse (GitHub) to evaluate and debug them to make sure they perform in production.\n\ud83e\udd9c LangGraph\nLangGraph extends the well-known LangChain library into a graph-based architecture that treats agent steps like nodes in a directed acyclic graph. Each node handles a prompt or sub-task, and edges control data flow and transitions. This is helpful for complex, multi-step tasks where you need precise control over branching and error handling. LangGraph\u2019s DAG philosophy makes it easier to visualize or debug how decisions flow from one step to another, and you still inherit a ton of useful tooling and integrations from LangChain.\nHow to trace LangGraph agents with Langfuse \u2192\nDevelopers who prefer to model AI tasks in stateful workflows often gravitate toward LangGraph. If your application demands robust task decomposition, parallel branching, or the ability to inject custom logic at specific stages, you might find LangGraph\u2019s explicit approach a good fit.\nOpenAI Agents SDK\nThe OpenAI Agents SDK is the latest entrant in the field. It packages OpenAI\u2019s capabilities into a more structured toolset for building agents that can reason, plan, and call external APIs or functions. By providing a specialized agent runtime and a straightforward API for assigning roles, tools, and triggers, OpenAI aims to simplify multi-step or multi-agent orchestration. While it\u2019s still evolving, developers appreciate the familiar style of prompts and the native integration with OpenAI\u2019s model endpoints.\nHow to trace the OpenAI Agents SDK with Langfuse \u2192\nIf you are already deep into OpenAI\u2019s stack and want an officially supported solution to spin up agents that utilize GPT-4o or GPT-o3, the OpenAI Agents SDK might be your first stop.\n\ud83e\udd17 Smolagents\nHugging Face\u2019s smolagents takes a radically simple, code-centric approach. Instead of juggling complex multi-step prompts or advanced orchestration, smolagents sets up a minimal loop where the agent writes and executes code to achieve a goal. It\u2019s ideal for scenarios where you want a small, self-contained agent that can call Python libraries or run quick computations without building an entire DAG or multi-agent conversation flow. That minimalism is the chief selling point: you can define a few lines of configuration and let the model figure out how to call your chosen tools or libraries.\nHow to trace smolagents with Langfuse \u2192\nIf you value fast setup and want to watch your AI generate Python code on the fly, smolagents provides a neat solution. It handles the \u201cReAct\u201d style prompting behind the scenes, so you can focus on what the agent should do rather than how it strings its reasoning steps together.\nCrewAI\nCrewAI is all about role-based collaboration among multiple agents. Imagine giving each agent a distinct skillset or personality, then letting them cooperate (or even debate) to solve a problem. This framework offers a higher-level abstraction called a \u201cCrew,\u201d which is basically a container for multiple agents that each has a role or function. The Crew coordinates workflows, allowing these agents to share context and build upon one another\u2019s contributions. I like CrewAI as it is easy to configure while still letting you attach advanced memory and error-handling logic.\nHow to trace CrewAI agents with Langfuse \u2192\nIf your use case calls for a multi-agent approach\u2014like a \u201cPlanner\u201d agent delegating tasks to a \u201cResearcher\u201d and \u201cWriter\u201d agent\u2014CrewAI makes that easy. The built-in memory modules and fluid user experience have led to growing adoption where collaboration and parallelization of tasks are important.\nAutoGen\nAutoGen, born out of Microsoft Research, frames everything as an asynchronous conversation among specialized agents. Each agent can be a ChatGPT-style assistant or a tool executor, and you orchestrate how they pass messages back and forth. This asynchronous approach reduces blocking, making it well-suited for longer tasks or scenarios where an agent needs to wait on external events. Developers who like the idea of \u201cmultiple LLMs in conversation\u201d may find AutoGen\u2019s event-driven approach nice, especially for dynamic dialogues that need real-time concurrency or frequent role switching.\nHow to trace AutoGen agents with Langfuse \u2192\nAutoGen is good if you\u2019re building an agent that heavily relies on multi-turn conversations and real-time tool invocation. It supports free-form chat among many agents and is backed by a research-driven community that consistently introduces new conversation patterns.\nSemantic Kernel\nSemantic Kernel is Microsoft\u2019s .NET-first approach to orchestrating AI \u201cskills\u201d and combining them into full-fledged plans or workflows. It supports multiple programming languages (C#, Python, Java) and focuses on enterprise readiness, such as security, compliance, and integration with Azure services. Instead of limiting you to a single orchestrator, you can create a range of \u201cskills,\u201d some powered by AI, others by pure code, and combine them. This design makes it popular among teams that want to embed AI into existing business processes without a complete rewrite of their tech stack.\nHow to trace Semantic Kernel with Langfuse \u2192\nIf you want a more formal approach that merges AI with non-AI services, Semantic Kernel is a strong bet. It has a structured \u201cPlanner\u201d abstraction that can handle multi-step tasks, making it well-suited for mission-critical enterprise apps.\n\ud83e\udd99 LlamaIndex Agents\nLlamaIndex started as a retrieval-augmented generation solution for powering chatbots with large document sets. Over time, it added agent-like capabilities to chain queries and incorporate external knowledge sources. LlamaIndex agents are good when your primary need is to retrieve data from local or external stores and fuse that information into coherent answers or actions. The tooling around indexing data, chunking text, and bridging your LLM with a knowledge base is top-notch, and that data-centric approach extends into the agent layer.\nHow to trace LlamaIndex Agents with Langfuse \u2192\nIf you\u2019re solving data-heavy tasks\u2014like question answering on private documents, summarizing large repositories, or building a specialized search agent\u2014LlamaIndex agents could be exactly what you need. The development experience feels intuitive if you\u2019ve already used LlamaIndex for retrieval, and it pairs nicely with other frameworks that focus on orchestration.\nStrands Agents\nStrands Agents SDK is a model-agnostic agent framework that runs anywhere and supports multiple model providers with reasoning and tool use, including Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, and others via LiteLLM. It emphasizes production readiness with first-class OpenTelemetry tracing and optional deep AWS integrations. This gives you end-to-end observability with a clean, declarative API for defining agent behavior. For a deeper technical overview of its agent architectures and observability, see AWS\u2019s technical deep dive.\nHow to trace Strands Agents with Langfuse \u2192\nStrands Agents runs anywhere (AWS, other clouds, or on-prem). If you\u2019re on AWS, you can opt into deep Bedrock integrations; otherwise, use any provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.) via LiteLLM\u2014while still pairing nicely with Langfuse\u2019s observability pipeline.\n\ud83d\udc0d Pydantic AI Agents\nPydantic AI brings Pydantic\u2019s famous type safety and ergonomic developer experience to agent development. You define your agent\u2019s inputs, tool signatures, and outputs as Python types, and the framework handles validation plus OpenTelemetry instrumentation under the hood. The result is FastAPI-style DX for GenAI applications.\nHow to trace Pydantic AI with Langfuse \u2192\nIf you\u2019re a Python developer who values explicit type contracts, tests, and quick feedback loops, Pydantic AI offers a lightweight yet powerful path to building production-ready agents with minimal boilerplate.\nComparison Table\nAs you can see there are very different approaches to these agent frameworks. Graph-based solutions like LangGraph give you precise control, while conversation-based solutions like AutoGen give you natural, flexible dialogues. Role-based orchestration from CrewAI can tackle complex tasks through a \u201ccast\u201d of specialized agents, whereas Smolagents is ideal for minimal code-driven patterns. Semantic Kernel is positioned in the enterprise space, and LlamaIndex Agents shine for retrieval-centric applications. The OpenAI Agents SDK appeals to users already confident in the OpenAI stack. Strands Agents is model-agnostic with optional deep AWS integrations, and Pydantic AI is tailored for Python environments.\nWhen to Use Each Framework\nRather than prescribing a specific tool, it\u2019s more important to focus on the high-level variables that should guide your decision:\n-\nTask Complexity and Workflow Structure:\nDetermine whether your task is simple or requires complex, multi-step reasoning. Complex workflows may benefit from explicit orchestration (like a graph-based or skill-based approach), whereas simpler tasks might be well served by a lightweight, code-centric solution. -\nCollaboration and Multi-Agents:\nCheck if your project needs multiple agents with distinct roles interacting in a coordinated way. Multi-agent collaboration might require an architecture that supports asynchronous conversations and role delegation. -\nIntegrations:\nConsider the environments and systems your agents need to interact with. Some frameworks provide easier integration for tool calling, while others are designed for rapid prototyping and minimal setup. -\nPerformance and Scalability\nThink about the performance demands of your application. High concurrency and real-time interactions may necessitate an event-driven architecture. Observability tools become crucial here, allowing you to trace agent behavior and optimize performance over time.\nBelow\u2019s a Mermaid flowchart outlining some of the key decision. However, please note that this is not an exhaustive list and framework abilities might overlap (e.g. OpenAI Agents SDK can be used for multi-agent workflows).\nWhy Agent Tracing and Observability Matter\nAgent frameworks involve a lot of moving parts. Each agent can call external APIs, retrieve data, or make decisions that branch into new sub-tasks. Keeping track of what happened, why it happened, and how it happened is vital, especially in production.\nObservability tools like Langfuse let you capture, visualize, and analyze agent \u201ctraces\u201d so you can see each prompt, response, and tool call in a structured timeline. This insight makes debugging far simpler and helps you refine prompts, measure performance, and ensure your AI behaves as expected.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about evaluating AI agents, check

Observability with Langfuse - Langfuse Blog", "text": "AI Agent Observability with Langfuse\nEasily monitor, trace and debug your AI agents. Explore tools like LangGraph, Llama Agents, Dify, Flowise, and Langflow, and see how Langfuse helps to monitor and optimize your application.\nWhat are AI Agents?\nAn AI agent is a system that autonomously performs tasks by planning its task execution and utilizing available tools. AI Agents leverage large language models (LLMs) to understand and respond to user inputs step-by-step and decide when to call external tools.\nTo solve tasks, agents use:\n- planning by devising step-by-step actions from the given task\n- tools to extend their capabilities like RAG, external APIs, or code interpretation/execution\n- memory to store and recall past interactions for additional contextual information\nWhat are Agents Used For?\nCommon use cases include:\n- Customer Support: AI agents use RAG to automate responses, autonomously take action and efficiently handle inquiries with accurate information.\n- Market Research: Agents collect and synthesize information from various sources, delivering accurate and concise summaries to users.\n- Software Development: AI agents break coding tasks into smaller sub-tasks and then recombine them to create a complete solution.\nDesign Patterns of AI Agents\nAn AI agent usually consists of 5 parts: A language model with general-purpose capabilities that serves as the main brain or coordinator, and four sub-modules: a planning module to divide the task into smaller steps, an action module that enables the agent to use external tools, a memory module to store and recall past interactions and a profile module, to describe the behavior of the agent.\nIn single-agent setups, one agent is responsible for solving the entire task autonomously. In multi-agent setups, multiple specialized agents collaborate, each handling different aspects of the task to achieve a common goal more efficiently. These agents are also often referred to as state-based or stateful agents as they route the task through different states.\nWhat is AI Agent Observability?\nObserving agents means tracking and analyzing the performance, behavior, and interactions of AI agents. This includes real-time monitoring of multiple LLM calls, control flows, decision-making processes, and outputs to ensure agents operate efficiently and accurately.\nLangfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform that provides deep insights into metrics such as latency, cost, and error rates, enabling developers to debug, optimize, and enhance their AI systems. Using Langfuse observability, teams can identify and resolve issues, streamline workflows, and maintain high-quality outputs by evaluating agent responses in complex, multi-step AI agents.\nWhy AI Agent Observability is Important\nDebugging and Edge Cases\nAgents use multiple steps to solve complex tasks, and inaccurate intermediary results can cause failures of the entire system. Tracing these intermediate steps and testing your application on known edge cases is essential.\nWhen deploying LLMs, some edge cases will always slip through in initial testing. A proper analytics set-up helps identify these cases, allowing you to add them to future test sets for more robust agent evaluations. With Datasets, Langfuse allows you to collect examples of inputs and expected outputs to benchmark new releases before deployment. Datasets can be incrementally updated with new edge cases found in production and integrated with existing CI/CD pipelines.\nTradeoff of Accuracy and Costs\nLLMs are stochastic by nature, meaning they are a statistical process that can produce errors or hallucinations. Calling language models multiple times while selecting the best or most common answer can increase accuracy. This can be a major advantage of using agentic workflows.\nHowever, this comes with a cost. The tradeoff between accuracy and costs in LLM-based agents is crucial, as higher accuracy often leads to increased operational expenses. Often, the agent decides autonomously how many LLM calls or paid external API calls it needs to make to solve a task, potentially leading to high costs for single-task executions. Therefore, it is important to monitor model usage and costs in real-time.\nLangfuse monitors both costs and accuracy, enabling you to optimize your application for production.\nUnderstanding User Interactions\nAI agents analytics allows you to capture how users interact with your LLM applications. This information is crucial for refining your AI application and tailoring responses to better meet user needs.\nLangfuse Analytics derives insights from production data, helping you measure quality through user feedback and model-based scoring over time and across different versions. It also allows you to monitor cost and latency metrics in real-time, broken down by user, session, geography, and model version, enabling precise optimizations for your LLM application.\nTools to build AI Agents\nYou do not need any specific tools to build AI agents. However, there are several open-source frameworks that can help you build complex, stateful, multi-agent applications.\nApplication Frameworks\nLangGraph\nLangGraph (GitHub) is an open-source framework by the LangChain team for building complex, stateful, multi-agent applications. LangGraph includes built-in persistence to save and resume state, which enables error recovery and human-in-the-loop workflows.\nLangGraph agents can be monitored with Langfuse to observe and debug the steps of an agent.\nLlama Agents\nLlama Agents (GitHub) is an open-source framework designed to simplify the process of building, iterating, and deploying multi-agent AI systems and turn your agents into production microservices.\nLangfuse offers a simple integration for automatic capture of traces and metrics generated in LlamaIndex applications.\nOpenAI Agents SDK\nOpenAI Agents SDK provides a simple yet powerful framework for building and orchestrating AI agents. By instrumenting the SDK with Langfuse, you can capture detailed traces of agent execution, including planning, function calls, and multi-agent handoffs. This integration enables you to monitor performance metrics, trace issues in real time, and optimize your workflows effectively.\nFor a comprehensive guide on setting up this integration, please refer to our Trace the OpenAI Agents SDK with Langfuse notebook.\nHugging Face smolagents\nHugging Face smolagents is a minimalist framework for building AI agents. With the Langfuse integration, you can effortlessly capture and visualize telemetry data from your agents. By initializing the SmolagentsInstrumentor, your agent interactions are traced using OpenTelemetry and displayed in Langfuse, enabling you to debug and optimize decision-making processes.\nFor a comprehensive, step-by-step guide, see our integration notebook: Observability for smolagents with Langfuse.\nNo-code Agent Builders\nFor prototypes and development by non-developers, no-code builders can be a great starting point.\nFlowise\nFlowise (GitHub) is a no-code builder. It lets you build customized LLM flows with a drag-and-drop editor. With the native Langfuse integration, you can use Flowise to quickly create complex LLM applications in no-code and then use Langfuse to analyze and improve them.\nExample of a catalog chatbot created in Flowise to answer any questions related to shop products.\nLangflow\nLangflow (GitHub) is a UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows.\nWith the native integration, you can use Langflow to quickly create complex LLM applications in no code and then use Langfuse to monitor and debug them.\nExample of a chat agent with chain-of-thought reasoning built in Langflow by Cobus Greyling.\nDify\nDify (GitHub) is an open-source LLM app development platform. Using their Agent Builder nd variety of templates, you can easily build an AI agent and then grow it into a more complex system via Dify workflows.\nWith the native Langfuse integration, you can use Dify to quickly create complex LLM applications and then use Langfuse to monitor and improve them.\nGet Started\nIf you want to get started with building your AI Agents and monitoring them with Langfuse, check out our end-to-end example of building a simple agent with LangGraph and tracking it with Langfuse.\nTo get an in-depth guide on when to use which agent framework, check out our AI

For example calling the Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\nmodel:\nimport os\nfrom langfuse.openai import OpenAI\nfrom langfuse import observe\n# Set up your environment variables\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\"] = \"sk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\"] = \"pk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_HOST\"] = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\"\nos.environ[\"HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN\"] = \"hf_...\"\n# Initialize the OpenAI client pointing to the Hugging Face Inference API\nclient = OpenAI(\nbase_url=\"https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/v1/\",\napi_key=os.getenv('HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN'),\n)\n# Optionally, use the @observe() decorator to trace other application logic as well\n@observe()\ndef get_poem():\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"model-name\", # this can be an arbitrary identifier\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Write a poem about language models\"},\n]\n)\nreturn completion.choices[0].message.content\nprint(get_poem())\nFor more examples, check out the Langfuse Hugging Face Integration documentation.\n2) Trace Hugging Face Smolagents with Langfuse\nFor developers using Hugging Face\u2019s minimalistic agent framework\u2014smolagents\u2014integrating with Langfuse can help you trace multi-step processes and monitor your agents\u2019 reasoning. Below is a simplified example that shows how to instrument smolagents:\nfrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider\nfrom opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter\nfrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor\nfrom openinference.instrumentation.smolagents import SmolagentsInstrumentor\n# Initialize the tracer provider and set up the OTLP exporter to send traces to Langfuse\ntrace_provider = TracerProvider()\ntrace_provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter()))\nSmolagentsInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=trace_provider)\n# Now, create a smolagent and run it\nfrom smolagents import CodeAgent, ToolCallingAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel\n# Initialize the model (you can provide additional parameters as needed)\nmodel = HfApiModel(model_id=\"deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B\")\n# Create an agent that can perform a web search\nsearch_agent = ToolCallingAgent(\ntools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],\nmodel=model,\nname=\"search_agent\",\ndescription=\"Agent to perform web searches.\"\n)\n# Create a manager agent that coordinates the operations\nmanager_agent = CodeAgent(\ntools=[],\nmodel=model,\nmanaged_agents=[search_agent],\n)\nresult = manager_agent.run(\"How can Langfuse be used to monitor and improve the reasoning of smolagents when executing multi-step tasks?\")\nprint(result)\nThis integration allows you to see detailed traces for each step your smolagent performs. Learn more about this integration in the smolagents documentation.\n3) Hugging Face Models in Playground and Evaluators\nYou can also use Hugging Face models in the Langfuse Playground and for LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators. This lets you test your prompts and use open source models for model-based evaluations.\nTo add a Hugging Face model in Langfuse, navigate to your project settings. Create a new model connection and select openai as the provider. Replace the API Base URL with the endpoint for the model (e.g. https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/v1/\n). Add your Hugging Face access token to the API Key field. For the model name, you can use any arbitrary identifier.\nLearn more about how to set up Langfuse\u2019s LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators and the Langfuse Playground.\n4) Hugging Face Datasets for Dataset Experiments\nHugging Face offers a variety of datasets that can be used to evaluate LLMs and AI agents. These datasets can be used to run Langfuse Dataset Experiments.\nThis example shows how you can bring Hugging Face datasets into your observability pipeline, allowing you to track performance and evaluation scores with Langfuse.\nFirst, we fetch a dataset from Hugging Face. In this case the GSM8K dataset containing math word problems.\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\n# Load a benchmark dataset (e.g., GSM8K)\ndataset = load_dataset(\"openai/gsm8k\", split=\"train[:10]\") # limit to first 10 for demo\ndf = pd.DataFrame(dataset)\nprint(\"First few rows of the dataset:\")\nprint(df.head())\n# Initialize your Langfuse client (ensure you have your API key configured)\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\"] = \"sk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\"] = \"pk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_HOST\"] = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\"\nlangfuse = Langfuse(api_key=os.getenv(\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\"))\n# Create a new dataset in Langfuse\ndataset_name = \"GSM8K_Benchmark\"\nlangfuse.create_dataset(\nname=dataset_name,\ndescription=\"Benchmark dataset for evaluating LLM performance\",\nmetadata={\"type\": \"benchmark\"}\n)\n# Upload each dataset item to Langfuse\nfor i, row in df.iterrows():\nlangfuse.create_dataset_item(\ndataset_name=dataset_name,\ninput={\"question\": row[\"question\"]},\nexpected_output={\"answer\": row[\"answer\"]},\nmetadata={\"index\": i}\n)\nYou can then loop over the dataset items to test your application for every dataset input.\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\"<langfuse_dataset_name>\")\n# Run our agent against each dataset item\nfor item in dataset.items:\nlangfuse_trace, output = run_your_application(item.input[\"text\"])\n# Link the trace to the dataset item for analysis\nitem.link(\nlangfuse_trace,\nrun_name=\"notebook-run-01\",\nrun_metadata={ \"model\": model.model_id }\n)\n# Optionally, store a quick evaluation score for demonstration\nlangfuse_trace.score(\nname=\"<example_eval>\",\nvalue=1,\ncomment=\"This is a comment\"\n)\nYou can repeat this process with different:\n- Models (OpenAI GPT, local LLM, etc.)\n- Tools (search vs. no search)\n- Prompts (different system messages)\nThen compare them side-by-side in Langfuse:\nFor more details on how to use Langfuse Dataset Experiments, check out the docs.\n5) Deploy Langfuse on Hugging Face Spaces\nLangfuse can also be deployed directly on Hugging Face Spaces\u2014combining the instant accessibility of Spaces with the power of Langfuse observability.\nTo deploy, simply create a new Hugging Face Space, select Docker as your SDK, and choose Langfuse as the template. You\u2019ll need to set up persistent storage and configure the environment variables for secure operation.\nFor a step-by-step guide on deploying Langfuse on Spaces, check out the Hugging Face Langfuse Spaces documentation.\nNext Steps\nFind out more about all features in the Langfuse docs.\n(Note: This blog post was also published on Hugging Face (link))", "links": [{"href":

Evaluation 101: Best Practices, Challenges & Proven Techniques - Langfuse Blog", "text": "LLM Evaluation 101: Best Practices, Challenges & Proven Techniques\nExplore proven strategies for LLM evaluation \u2014 from offline and online benchmarking \u2013 this post briefs you on the state of the art.\nEvaluating large language models can feel like trying to untangle a giant ball of yarn\u2014there\u2019s a lot going on, and it\u2019s often not obvious which thread to pull first. From wrangling unpredictable user inputs to picking the right metrics, the process can be overwhelming. But don\u2019t panic! In this post, we\u2019ll walk through some tried-and-true best practices, common pitfalls, and handy tips to help you benchmark your LLM\u2019s performance. Whether you\u2019re just starting out or looking for a quick refresher, these guidelines will keep your evaluation strategy on solid ground.\nEvaluation Challenges\nWhen it comes to LLMs, \u201cevaluation\u201d is more than just a single metric or one-time test. Their outputs can be astonishingly diverse\u2014sometimes correct, sometimes creative, and sometimes surprisingly off-base.\nOne major hurdle is defining clear evaluation goals. Traditional software metrics (like error rates) may not translate well when your model might encounter any question under the sun. You\u2019ll want to pin down what \u201cgood\u201d looks like\u2014whether it\u2019s accuracy, helpfulness, or creativity\u2014before you even begin.\nBecause LLMs generate text rather than just classifying it, subjective interpretation creeps into the equation. Deciding how to measure factors like \u201cclarity\u201d or \u201ccoherence\u201d can be tricky without well-defined rubrics or specialized metrics.\nAnd then there\u2019s the operational side of evaluation:\nCost and Latency: Testing at scale (especially with human annotators) can run up costs quickly. Automated approaches may be faster, but they\u2019re not always reliable enough on their own.\nTrust in Automated Tools: Automated evaluators (including ones powered by smaller models) can drift or fail in unexpected ways. Keeping them aligned with real human perspectives takes constant upkeep.\nCross-Team Collaboration: Getting engineers, data scientists, product managers, and domain experts to work in sync is crucial. Without a clear process or shared vocabulary, you risk chaotic handoffs and scattered efforts.\nExample: Simplified Customer Support RAG Chat\nWhen you\u2019re dealing with a workflow that spans multiple steps\u2014like the above RAG pipeline\u2014each stage needs its own evaluation criteria. Otherwise, you\u2019ll struggle to pinpoint exactly where things go wrong (or right).\nData Model for Evaluation \u2013 Traces\nTo make sense of all these moving parts, it helps to have an organized way to record exactly what\u2019s happening at each step. That\u2019s where traces come in. Traces capture detailed logs of user interactions, intermediate steps, and final outputs, giving you a treasure trove of data for diagnosing issues and measuring performance over time.\nExample of a trace in Langfuse](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/8ed12d68-353f-464f-bc62-720984c3b6a0?display=graph)\nPinpoint Failures: By following a trace from input to output, you can spot where the model (or a sub-component) stumbles.\nQuantify Performance: Compare model outputs against ground truths or reference answers.\nAccelerate Iteration: With detailed traces, it\u2019s easy to see which inputs cause the biggest problems and quickly focus your tuning efforts there.\nOnline vs. Offline Evaluation\nEffective LLM evaluation usually blends offline (development/test) and online (production) methods, each catching different types of errors and insights.\nOffline Evaluation:\nYou\u2019ll typically run your model on curated datasets\u2014maybe as part of your CI pipeline or local dev tests (Read more on datasets here). Smaller datasets are great for quick, \u201cgut check\u201d experiments; larger ones provide a broader sweep of performance indicators. The main challenge is making sure these test sets stay relevant and actually resemble what you\u2019ll see in the wild.\nThe image below shows an example of a dataset in Langfuse with inputs and expected outputs:\nOnline Evaluation:\nRunning evaluations in a live environment lets you spot issues like model drift (where performance gradually degrades over time) or unexpected user queries you never anticipated. But gathering feedback in production can be tricky; you need solid data capture processes and a clear plan for feeding these insights back into your development cycle.\nThe image below shows an example of a live LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluator in Langfuse that scores new traces for toxicity:\nA balanced approach\u2014where you do regular offline benchmarking and maintain some form of continuous production monitoring\u2014tends to yield the most robust results.\nCommon Evaluation Techniques\nNo single method will capture everything about your model\u2019s behavior, so it often pays to mix and match.\nUser Feedback:\nDirect feedback\u2014like user ratings or open-ended comments\u2014offers the clearest signal of whether your LLM is hitting the mark. However, collecting and organizing these insights at scale can be expensive and time-consuming.\nExample of user feedback captured in ChatGPT:\nImplicit User Feedback (Human-in-the-Loop):\nInstead of waiting for explicit ratings, you can infer quality from user behavior: Did they ask the same question again? Did they click on recommended links? Though it\u2019s usually easier to gather, the signal can be noisy and needs careful interpretation.\nHuman Annotation:\nHaving experts (or crowdworkers) label or grade outputs can provide deep insights, especially for complex tasks. The downside is cost and time: human annotation doesn\u2019t scale easily.\nExample of a human annotation workflow in Langfuse:\nAutomated Evaluation:\nUsing metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or specialized generative metrics can give a quick, numerical snapshot of performance. Tools like OpenAI Evals, LangChain Evals, and RAGAS fall in this bucket. These are fast and repeatable but must be validated against human judgment to avoid misleading conclusions.\nExample of different automated evaluation scores over time in Langfuse:\nTraces are the underlying thread across all these methods\u2014by systematically logging interactions, you create a structured record that each evaluation technique can draw from.\nAutomated Evaluation Techniques\nFor certain applications\u2014like extraction and classification tasks\u2014precision, recall, and F-score offer clear, quantifiable measures. But not all tasks are that straightforward, especially when an LLM is expected to generate paragraphs of text or whole chat conversations.\nLLM-as-a-Judge Approaches:\nYou can enlist another machine learning model\u2014or even a specialized LLM-based evaluator (sometimes called \u201cmodel based evals\u201d)\u2014to score outputs. These can be flexible, but there\u2019s always the risk of propagating the same biases or blind spots. Calibrating them against human-annotated samples helps. Find out more on using LLM-as-a-Judge evals here.\nNon-model-based Approaches:\nIn some cases, simpler rule-based checks (like regex patterns) can be surprisingly effective. They\u2019re cheap and transparent but won\u2019t scale to more nuanced tasks.\nUltimately, common toolkits like built in LLM-as-a-Judge evals or external libraries like OpenAI Evals and RAGAS help streamline the setup for automated checks. Still, every application has its own quirks. Tailored evaluators or custom heuristics often deliver the best insights if you invest the time to build them correctly.\nApplication-Specific Challenges\nWhat makes LLM evaluation both fascinating and challenging is how different each use case can be:\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nBecause you\u2019re evaluating both the retrieval step and the generative step, it\u2019s helpful to measure them separately. For example, you might track relevance and precision for document retrieval, then apply generative metrics (like RAGAS) to the summarized output. (Guide on using RAGAS here)\nAgent-Based LLM Applications:\nHere, the model isn\u2019t just producing text\u2014it\u2019s also making decisions or taking actions based on user inputs. Evaluating such agents usually involves simulating interactive conversations and carefully checking each intermediate decision. Human-in-the-loop feedback can be especially helpful to confirm the agent\u2019s logic or to flag any odd behavior.\nVoice Agent Evaluation:\nVoice-based applications bring unique challenges, as they combine speech recognition, synthesis, and interactive dialogue. Evaluating these agents often requires assessing both the conversational dynamics and the audio processing performance. For a comprehensive overview of best practices and challenges in this area, see our dedicated guide: Evaluating and Monitoring Voice AI Agents.\nGetting Started with LLM Evaluation\nIf you\u2019re just dipping your toes into LLM evaluation\u2014or need a refresher\u2014here\u2019s a straightforward way to kick off:\nCollect Data\nUse traces or structured logs from real interactions or test runs. This is your source of truth.\nExperiment with Different Methods\nDon\u2019t rely on just one technique. Try human annotation, automated metrics, user feedback\u2014even pairwise comparisons if that fits your use case.\nSet Baselines\nEstablish performance benchmarks (even if they\u2019re rough) so you can see progress or detect regressions over time.\nPick Your Environment\nDecide whether to run initial tests offline for quick iteration or go straight to production for immediate, real-world feedback.\nClose the Loop\nFeed learnings from production back into development. In other words, if you spot new failure modes in the wild, incorporate them into your offline test sets.\nFor more in-depth guidance on setting up your evaluation workflows with Langfuse, check out the evaluation docs. It\u2019s packed with best practices and step-by-step instructions for capturing traces, running tests, and refining your pipeline.\nFinal Thoughts\nEvaluating LLMs is never a one-and-done task. As your model and user base evolve, your evaluation strategies need to keep pace. By combining offline benchmarks with real-time insights, leveraging traces, and staying open to new techniques, you\u2019ll be well on your way to building more reliable, impactful LLM applications.",

David Zhang\u2019s Open Deep Research - Langfuse Blog", "text": "The Agent Deep Dive: David Zhang\u2019s Open Deep Research\nThis blog post explores David Zhang\u2019s open-source framework for iterative AI research. We look at the system\u2019s query process, parallel search executions, and markdown report creation, and compare it to both OpenAI\u2019s and Perplexity\u2019s research solutions.\nAI-driven research is evolving fast. While Google pioneered Deep Research, OpenAI popularized it and Perplexity and Grok followed, open-source alternatives are just as exciting and help to understand how one of the first forms of autonomous useful agents works. In this post, I take a closer look at the inner workings of open deep-research by David Zhang (dzhng)\u2014a lightweight, transparent framework for iterative AI research.\nAt under 500 lines of code, deep-research\npacks a surprising punch. It runs recursive research loops, refining queries based on the information it finds\u2014no hidden logic, no unnecessary dependencies, just a clean, modular setup that\u2019s easy to hack or extend.\nI decided to put it to the test. With Langfuse, I traced its execution (thanks to @hassiebp for instrumenting it in this fork), broke down its decision-making, and measured performance. Below, I\u2019ll show how it works, why it\u2019s worth a look, and how it compares to other AI deep research tools.\nWhy I Like This Agent\n- Simple \u2013 Minimalist design, easy to modify, and fully open-source.\n- Iterative Research \u2013 Runs deep research loops, refining its queries at each step.\n- Control Depth & Breadth \u2013 Users define how far (depth) and wide (breadth) the research should go.\n- Parallel Execution \u2013 Fires off multiple queries at once, speeding up research.\nTech Stack:\n- o3-mini as the language model for SERP generation, learnings, and the final report.\n- Firecrawl for executing SERP queries.\nDespite its minimal footprint, the framework is robust enough to generate meaningful follow-up questions, refine its search, and compile a structured final report. This simplicity makes it an approachable playground for anyone looking to experiment with or build upon an iterative AI research agent.\nHow Does the Agent Work?\nTo see how deep-research\nholds up, I asked it a more nuanced question:\n\u201cI don\u2019t get how Whisper is fully open source (MIT), yet ChatGPT\u2019s speech-to-text is vastly better than Perplexity\u2019s and Apple\u2019s. Can you help me figure this out?\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t a simple fact lookup\u2014it requires synthesizing multiple sources, filtering insights, and producing structured responses.\nWith a breadth of 4 and a depth of 2 (which are the two configuration options that are available), we might see the agent generate multiple parallel queries\u2014and then refine those queries after it sees what the search turned up. You\u2019d end up with a thorough markdown report summarizing everything, plus any missing links the agent found intriguing.\nEach iteration of this loop can be viewed as an event within Langfuse. Tracking these events provides a step-by-step replay of the agent\u2019s logic\u2014useful for debugging and fine-tuning. Here\u2019s the public trace in Langfuse:\nNote: The chart above is a Gantt-like overview of query processes.\nNext, let\u2019s break down each step of the research loop in more detail.\n1. Initial Query\nThe system message and user prompt are created. This is where the agent sets the context.\n2. Follow-Up Questions\nThe agent proposes up to three follow-up questions based on the initial prompt.\n3. Search Queries\nBased on those follow-up questions, the agent generates SERP queries to investigate the topic further.\n4. Search Engine Calls\nThe system then spawns multiple queries to a search API (in this case, Firecrawl).\n5. Learnings from the Content\nAfter retrieving the search results, the agent processes them and generates up to three \u201clearnings\u201d (insights). It also proposes new follow-up questions, continuing the loop if necessary.\n6. Markdown Report\nFinally, once the maximum research breadth (e.g., 4) and depth (e.g., 2) are reached, the agent compiles a Markdown report summarizing key findings. It uses all the intermediate \u201clearnings\u201d from previous steps to form a coherent answer.\nThanks to the instrumentation we added above, all these steps are tracked in Langfuse\u2014timestamps, search calls, LLM calls, and final outputs\u2014providing a transparent view of how the agent arrives at its answer.\nComparison With Other AI Research Tools\nAlthough deep-research\nis a small, open-source project, I wanted to see how it fares alongside two well-known AI tools: OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT (with advanced research features or higher usage tiers) and Perplexity Pro.\nTo keep it fair, I ran the same question on all three:\nDavid Zhang\u2019s Open Deep Research\n- Time to finish: ~3 minutes and 34 seconds\n- Estimated model usage cost: ~$0.71\n- Generated report length: ~12k characters\n- Trace: Langfuse Link\nOpenAI\u2019s Deep Research\n- Time to finish: ~6 minutes\n- Insights: ~27 sources\n- Generated report length: ~87k characters\n- Costs: Hard to pin down exactly; it likely depends on o3 and crawler usage.\n- Example link: OpenAI Example Thread\nPerplexity Pro Deep Research\n- Time to finish: ~3 minutes\n- Insights: ~49 sources\n- Report length: ~8k characters\n- Link to Perplexity Thread: Perplexity Deep Research Example\nTakeaways\ndeep-research\nis impressively agile for a lean, open-source tool.- Perplexity\u2019s product can pull in a larger number of sources quickly, leveraging its specialization on web search.\n- OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research produced a lengthy report, utilized more sources, and conducted a thorough investigation based on follow-up searches. Overall, the reasoning capabilities (o3, post-training for this use case) are significantly stronger than those of the other contestants.\nUltimately, if you want transparency, low cost, and hackability, David Zhang\u2019s deep-research\nstands out. If you need huge reports or integrated browsing at scale, you may prefer a more mature commercial solution.\nOther Open Source Research Agent Frameworks\nIf you\u2019re interested in exploring similar projects, check out these options:\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nI will do more deep dives on interesting OSS agents to dissect how they work and what\u2019s interesting about them.

Monitoring Voice AI Agents - Langfuse Blog", "text": "A Guide to Evaluating Voice AI Agents\nA comprehensive guide to production and development evaluation of Voice AI applications based on a conversation with Brooke Hopkins from Coval.\nAs Voice AI applications continue to advance, developers are met with complex challenges in testing, evaluating, and monitoring their voice agents.\nIn this blog post, we\u2019ll explore how you can create more robust and reliable voice applications. We\u2019ll draw insights from setups we have seen from our users at Langfuse and the recent discussion (full video) between me and Brooke (Co-Founder of Coval) to provide a comprehensive guide on Voice AI evaluation.\nThe Evolution of Voice AI Testing\nVoice AI applications present complexities that extend beyond traditional LLM implementations. In addition to challenges caused by the non-deterministic nature of language models, developers must also handle:\n- Audio Quality and Metrics\n- User Interruptions\n- Speech-to-Text (STT) Accuracy\n- Text-to-Speech (TTS) Output Quality\n- Real-Time Streaming Interactions\nAs voice applications mature, the need for both high-level integration testing and detailed component evaluation becomes critical.\nUnderstanding the Voice AI Testing Pyramid\nDeveloping effective voice applications requires a dual approach to evaluation strategies:\n- Online Evaluation: Focuses on real-time production monitoring, performance tracking, and analyzing user interactions.\n- Offline Evaluation: Involves development testing, ranging from end-to-end agent testing to granular unit tests and validating conversation flows.\nUsing this testing pyramid is essential for effective Voice AI testing, ensuring your voice agents perform optimally in live environments.\nEvaluations of Single Messages vs. Conversation Level\nThe second duality we see in voice agent evaluation is between observing and evaluating single messages and evals on the whole conversation.\nSingle turn evaluations:\n- Trace the step-by-step execution of a single message\n- Monitor the tool calls and other application logic used by the voice agent\n- Stream-based interaction analysis\nMulti turn evaluations:\n- Performing end-to-end simulation testing on the whole conversation\n- Testing for regressions caused by different prompt versions or model changes\n- Classifying and detecting anomalies in the conversation flow\nIntegration Best Practices and Development Workflow\nUsually, there are two phases in the voice agent development workflow:\nEarly development stages:\n- Quick integration tests and online evaluations\n- Trace and debug individual components of the conversation\nApplication running in production:\n- Implement specific unit tests for cases spotted in development\n- Detailed performance monitoring and conversation level evaluations\n- Ongoing regression testing\nThe type of evaluation also depends on the type of the voice application. Some applications might require a closer monitoring of model costs whereas other might focus on the conversation flow and the accuracy of tool calls:\nTransactional Voice Applications (e.g., Appointment Scheduling):\n- Trace individual function calls and apply evaluations to single messages.\n- Perform end-to-end testing of complete user journeys.\nComplex Applications (e.g., Virtual Assistants):\n- Focus on conversation-level testing and monitor conversation arcs.\n- Monitor tool calls and application logic.\nWe are excited that Coval will natively integrate with Langfuse. With this integration, Langfuse users can use Coval to perform end-to-end simulation testing on the whole conversation of their voice agents.

Infrastructure Evolution - Langfuse Blog", "text": "From Zero to Scale: Langfuse's Infrastructure Evolution\nA deep dive into how we evolved Langfuse's infrastructure from a simple prototype to a scalable observability platform.\nLangfuse, the open-source LLM observability platform, emerged from the Y Combinator Winter 2023 batch. After building many LLM applications ourselves and realizing that it is hard to go from demo to production, we worked closely with a few of our batchmates to quickly develop a v0 LLM observability platform.\nInitially, we focused on getting a few core features right: SDKs were asynchronous, Langfuse was based on tracing, and all components were open source and easily self-hostable. The first version was written on NextJs, Vercel, and Postgres. Little did we know we would rapidly evolve from an experiment to processing tens of thousands of events per minute.\nOur recent V3 release marks a significant milestone in ensuring Langfuse can scale for all of our users. We have piloted many of these changes on Langfuse Cloud already, and the v3 release now also makes them available to self-hosting users, such as online evaluations, async/queued ingestion, and cached prompts.\nIn this post, we will walk you through the scaling challenges we faced while building Langfuse and how our \u201chypothesis - experiment - feedback\u201d loop helped us arrive at Langfuse v3. If you are interested in solving similar challenges with us - we are hiring in Berlin!\nWhere it all started\nBefore embarking on this journey, this was our architecture. A single container and a Postgres database. It was incredibly simple to run and self-host, but it was also incredibly hard to scale.\nWe faced a couple of core challenges that led us to rethink our architecture. These are the most important ones:\nChallenge 1: Building a Resilient High-Throughput Ingestion Pipeline\nGoal: Ingestion API needs to accept high volumes of events and maintain consistently low latency under unpredictable load patterns.\nThe core of Langfuse\u2019s observability platform relies on efficient event data collection through our SDKs and API. While we designed these SDKs to minimize performance impact on our users\u2019 applications, the ingestion server-components faced significant challenges as we scaled:\nInitial Pain Point: By summer 2023, spiky traffic patterns led to response times on our ingestion API spiking up to 50 seconds.\nCritical Requirement: Our ingestion API needs to maintain consistently low latency to ensure smooth event flushing from the SKDs. Otherwise, our user\u2019s applications might be impacted negatively.\nThe challenge wasn\u2019t just about handling high volumes of data\u2014it was about maintaining reliability under unpredictable load patterns while ensuring minimal impact on our users\u2019 application performance. This technical hurdle became our first major scaling challenge, pushing us to rethink our ingestion architecture to handle traffic spikes more gracefully.\nChallenge 2: Optimizing Prompt Delivery for Production Workloads\nGoal: Prompts API needs to be highly available and performant at all times.\nA critical feature of Langfuse is our Prompt Management System, allowing users to define prompts through our UI and retrieve them via SDKs - doing away with the need to re-deploy your application to change a prompt.\nWhile tracing is asynchronous and non-blocking, prompts are in the critical path of LLM applications. This made a seemingly straightforward functionality a complex performance challenge: During high ingestion periods, our p95 latency for prompt retrieval spiked to 7 seconds. The situation demanded an architectural solution that could maintain consistent low-latency performance, even under heavy system load from other operations.\nChallenge 3: Fast analytical reads (Dashboards, Table Filters)\nGoal: Dashboards and table filters need to work for large-scale observability data.\nOur initial database choice of Postgres served us well in the early days, but as our largest customers began pushing more observability data through the system, we hit significant performance bottlenecks. Despite optimizing queries, our dashboards and table filtering operations became painfully slow for enterprise users. With LLM analytical data often consisting of large blobs, row-oriented storage was too heavy on disk when scanning through millions of rows. The irony wasn\u2019t lost on us - the very customers who needed our analytics capabilities the most were experiencing the worst performance. This growing pain signaled that our initial architecture, while perfect for rapid development, needed a fundamental rethink to handle enterprise-scale analytical workloads.\nChallenge 4: Easy to self-host\nGoal: Langfuse must be easy to self-host, but also scalable with little operational effort.\nBuilding Langfuse as an open-source project was a deliberate choice. Our vision was simple: anyone should be able to explore Langfuse with a simple docker-compose up\n, but at the same time Langfuse must be able to serve enterprise-scale deployments with hundreds of users and thousands of LLM interactions per minute. This approach reflects our own preferences as developers - we value solutions that are easy to evaluate and deploy.\nHowever, building a production-grade open-source observability platform comes with distinct challenges:\n- Universal Deployability: Our infrastructure needs to work seamlessly across diverse environments, from a developer\u2019s laptop to deployments on different hyperscalers\n- Open-Source Dependencies: We\u2019re committed to using only open-source components to ensure unrestricted self-hosting capabilities\n- Zero-Touch Operations: Enterprise users require automated maintenance and upgrade paths - manual intervention is too error prone and not scalable.\nThis balance between simplicity and enterprise-readiness has shaped our architectural decisions, pushing us to create a solution that\u2019s both accessible and scalable.\nNew building blocks\nTo address these challenges, we added multiple building blocks to our stack. In this post, we take you on our journey of how we iterated on our stack.\nBuilding Block 1: Asynchronous Processing of ingestion data\nFrom sync to async processing\nWe started out with an ingestion pipeline which receives a number of events per API call, iterates over them, and processes each event individually. During processing, we first search for a historic row with the same ID, tokenise prompts and completions of LLM calls, calculate cost, and upsert the event in our database. When looking into our telemetry, we realized we had two major bottlenecks: Postgres IOPS exhaustion and CPU consumption when tokenising large strings. Both of these are a risk to the uptime and latency of our application. In the worst cases, we lost events and returned HTTP 500 errors on our ingestion API.\nWhen considering a solution, we realized that simply increasing the number of containers would not be effective. We often experience significant spikes in ingested traffic when individual users run large-scale batch jobs. As a result, API traffic from our users is highly unpredictable, and container instances cannot scale quickly enough to manage these spikes. We ultimately decided to route all our ingestion traffic through a message queue in Redis. Unlike Kafka, Redis is easily self-hostable and can scale to meet our requirements. Another Langfuse container will then consume this data asynchronously and apply rate limiting to reduce the load on our database and the CPU usage of the container. With this change, we created a lightweight ingestion endpoint that only checks for authentication and body formats. The other container will handle the more intensive tasks of tokenizing and writing to the database.\nWriting updates to Clickhouse without reading from Clickhouse\nWe only did the steps above because we needed to improve our API performance short term. However, the job was not finished yet. Even if the worker container is doing all the processing asynchronously, we still needed too many Postgres IOPS to operate the logic of our ingestion pipeline. Self-hosting users reached out to us about this issue as well. At the same time, we had the challenge of improving the API latencies of our read queries. We eventually decided to migrate our tracing data from Postgres to Clickhouse. Clickhouse is an OLAP database, which is used by many new starters in the observability space, has an Apache License, and we observed outstanding performance in our Proof of Concepts. Its column-oriented storage layout was a better fit for the analytical queries that we expected, while still performing well for single-row lookups with large binary columns. Yet, adopting it in production was not easy at all.\nOur SDKs are designed to send updates to our backend for a given object ID. Single row reads and updates in Postgres are fast and easy, while every row update in ClickHouse is an immensely expensive operation. We transition our updates into new inserts and use ClickHouse\u2019s ReplacingMergeTree\ntable engine to eventually deduplicate rows in the background.\nThis implies that we always need to get the latest state of a row, apply the update, and write it back to Clickhouse.\nWe analyzed our traffic and realized that 90% of all updates are written to the database within 10 seconds. This means that we had to watch out for concurrency and data consistency. Reading from Clickhouse was not feasible to get the latest state of a row. Clickhouse is only read-after-write consistent when using the prohibitively expensive \u201cselect_sequential_consistency\u201d setting which ensures that all data is synced across Clickhouse nodes before returning a result to a query. Hence, at our scale, there would be no guarantee to read existing data from Clickhouse. Also, two events could be processed concurrently for the same ID leading to race conditions.\nTo mitigate this, we decided to cache all our acknowledged events in Redis. We would then send an event to our worker container, which would get all events for an object ID and reliably create the new Clickhouse row without needing to read from Clickhouse at all. We went ahead and implemented the new ingestion pipeline and started processing events in parallel to our Postgres ingestion pipeline.\nWe quickly encountered network capacity limitations on AWS ElastiCache, even with a very large instance. Another drawback of Redis is its in-memory architecture and the ephemeral nature of stored data. By introducing S3 as persistent storage for events, we could retain only references in Redis. This change also allowed us to replay events in case of errors and, surprisingly, significantly reduced the CPU usage of our web containers, as serializing events for Redis was an expensive operation. While Kafka might have been a better fit for ingestion, we chose to keep fewer components by leveraging Redis\u2019s caching capabilities and S3 for our new multi-modal features. With these adjustments, we successfully managed to insert data into Clickhouse consistently and at scale.\nBuilding Block 2: Caching + Decoupled Infrastructure\nWhile solving the data ingestion problem into Clickhouse, we still needed to improve the situation for our users using our prompt management feature. When analysing our observability data, we realized that the prompts API had issues for multiple reasons: high ingestion traffic could exhaust the database IOPS or CPU of our containers.\nFirst, we tried to avoid round-trips to our Postgres database to retrieve prompts. Here, we really observed the power of Redis as a cache and the impact it can have. As we know when prompts are updated, we can efficiently invalidate the cache without risking stale results.\nSecond, we separate the latency- and availability-sensitive infrastructure, including prompts and authentication, into a dedicated deployment. By using LoadBalancer rules and dedicated TargetGroups for specific endpoints in AWS ECS, we can isolate the ingestion traffic from the rest of the application. An added benefit is the increased observability that dedicated routes provide. Although this configuration is not part of the Helm Chart yet, it can be emulated across all major cloud providers and Kubernetes if needed.\nWith these two changes, we managed to bring the p99 of our prompts API from 7 seconds to 100 ms.\nThird, we updated our SDKs to use zero-latency prompt fetching. If a version of a prompt was previously retrieved from the API, we use that version for the next LLM call and perform the call to Langfuse\u2019s API in the background. This way, we removed prompts from the critical path of our user\u2019s applications.\nBuilding Block 3: OLAP Database + Query Optimization\nThe last piece for the transition towards Langfuse V3 was to optimize read queries and arrive at consistently low latencies for all our users. As we started working on this, we were already writing data to Clickhouse in parallel to Postgres. This helped us to be able to experiment with the way we store and retrieve data from Clickhouse. There were multiple stages at which we thought that we got it right, but then more data arrived.\nInitially, we set out that all calls for data within the past week, including single-record lookups should complete within 1s for the p99 and for more than a week of data, we considered 4s to be acceptable. In addition to our regular tracing in Datadog, we built a framework to emit the Postgres and ClickHouse read at the same time and measure their latency differences. Seeing the consistent and improved results gave us confidence that we were on the right track.\nThe first thing we had to get right were the table schemas, partitioning, and ordering keys of our data. Changing those required a full table rewrite, i.e. every update could take days. Conversations with other ClickHouse users and the ClickHouse docs made us decide early on that the projectId and date would be the first two columns of our ordering key. We expanded that to include the item id with skip indexes on columns that were frequently used for filtering. Other than Postgres, ClickHouse does not allow you to keep B-Tree indexes for efficient row lookups. One must always try to search through the data based on the disk layout.\nJoins were the second thing that we had to optimize. Our traces to observation joins took multiple seconds and frequently exhausted all available memory on our ClickHouse nodes. We learned that ClickHouse struggles to effectively filter the right side of a join. We dropped joins wherever possible, and manually pushed down filters as far as possible through the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs). In some cases, we added additional information like timestamps to our frontend API calls to make better use of the ordering key for single trace and observation lookups.\nThose were the challenges that we anticipated - from here on we go into some of the idiosyncracies of ClickHouse. First, we had to find a way to deduplicate data within our ReplacingMergeTree. While ClickHouse eventually deduplicates rows, we observed many duplicates within the first minutes and hours after insertion which made our metrics and dashboards for shorter timeframes near unusable. Using the FINAL keyword helped, but led to other surprises - more resources consumed during queries and not using any of our skip index optimizations. We relied on a mix of deduplication by write timestamp (order by with limit by), FINAL keywords, and distinct aggregations to arrive at reliable metrics, tables, and views.\nSpending a lot of research on schema design had a big payoff in our ClickHouse migration. We only needed minor adjustments throughout the whole process and got away with a single data import from Postgres into ClickHouse. For the remaining optimizations, iterating quickly paid off as we could never predict what would work for our specific use case. Great observability and a solid experimentation framework provided quick feedback to iterate and form a new hypothesis on. The old adage repeats - spend time thinking about things that are hard to change, but move quickly if you can.\nResulting improvements in performance across frontend and backend API calls which was previously driven by outliers in large projects:\nV3 Architecture\nAs a summary, these were the major changes we made to the architecture of Langfuse v3:\n- A new worker container that processes events asynchronously.\n- A new S3/Blob store for storing large objects.\n- A new Clickhouse instance for storing traces, observations, and scores.\n- Redis/Valkey for queuing events and caching data.\nConclusion\nWe are extremely happy with the Langfuse v3 release. Positive feedback from cloud users, high adoption among self-hosters in the first week, and a small list of issues demonstrate that we made many right decisions throughout the project. Testing new ideas quickly and being guided by a strong hypothesis with clear data allowed us to make significant progress.\nHowever, we often misjudged timelines during the project. For future initiatives, we plan to limit the scope to a maximum of one month and introduce more milestones along the way. Additionally, key personnel were often distracted by ongoing incidents and bug fixes as Langfuse is growing quickly while this project was in progress.\nWe will retain our data-driven culture, a straightforward method for running experiments on subsets of production data, and excellent observability across the entire stack. These elements help us maximize the value of each hour spent and continue to delight our customers, both self-hosted and cloud-based.\nDon\u2019t Miss Out\nSelf-hosting docs\nHost the new V3 release of Langfuse on your own infrastructure.

"Langfuse Launch Week #2\nA week dedicated to unlocking model capabilities and integrating Langfuse into your development loop\nWe are excited to announce Langfuse Launch Week #2!\nStarting on Monday, November 18th, 2024, we\u2019ll unveil a major upgrade to the Langfuse platform every day until Friday. We\u2019re topping it off with a Product Hunt launch on Friday and a Virtual Town Hall on Wednesday.\nStar us on GitHub and follow us on Twitter for daily updates.\nWant to see what we have launched in LW1 back in April to get a taste of what\u2019s coming? Check out the blog post.\nLaunch Week Focus\nThis week, we\u2019re focusing on supporting the next generation of models. As AI models evolve Langfuse is evolving too. We\u2019re integrating Langfuse deeply into your development loop with end-to-end prompt engineering workflow tooling tailored for product development teams. Stay tuned for the exciting updates ahead!\n\ud83d\ude80 Day 0: Prompt Management for Vercel AI SDK\nimport { generateText } from \"ai\";\nimport { Langfuse } from \"langfuse\";\nconst langfuse = new Langfuse();\n// fetch prompt from Langfuse Prompt Management\nconst fetchedPrompt = await langfuse.getPrompt(\"my-prompt\");\nconst result = await generateText({\nmodel: openai(\"gpt-4o\"),\nprompt: fetchedPrompt.prompt, // use prompt\nexperimental_telemetry: {\nisEnabled: true, // enable tracing\nmetadata: {\nlangfusePrompt: fetchedPrompt.toJSON(), // link trace to prompt version\n},\n},\n});\nLangfuse Prompt Management now integrates natively with the Vercel AI SDK. Version and release prompts in Langfuse, use them via Vercel AI SDK, monitor metrics in Langfuse.\nThis helps you answer questions like:\n- Which prompt version caused a particular bug?\n- What is the average latency and cost impact of a prompt version?\n- Which prompt version is the most used?\nSee the changelog for more details.\n\ud83c\udd9a Day 1: Dataset Experiment Run Comparison View\nLangfuse Datasets now features a powerful comparison view for dataset experiment runs. This new interface allows both technical and non-technical users to analyze multiple experiment runs side by side. Compare your application\u2019s performance across different test dataset experiment runs, examine metrics like latency and cost, and dive deep into individual dataset items. Use it to accelerate your testing of different prompts, models, or application configurations.\nSee the changelog for more details.\n\u2696\ufe0f Day 2: LLM-as-a-judge for Dataset Experiments\nLangfuse now brings managed LLM-as-a-judge evaluators to dataset experiments. Assign evaluators to your datasets and they will automatically run on new experiment runs, scoring your outputs based on your evaluation criteria. You can use any LLM that supports tool/function calling (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock) and choose from built-in templates for criteria like hallucination, helpfulness, relevance, toxicity, and more. Unlike previous evaluators that were limited to production runs, these new evaluators can access your dataset\u2019s ground truth (expected_output\n) for reliable offline evaluation - helping teams catch issues before they reach production.\nSee the changelog for more details or watch the video above for a walkthrough.\n\ud83c\udfa8 Day 3: Full multi-modal support, including audio, images, and attachments\nLangfuse now supports multi-modal traces including images, audio files, and attachments, enabling you to observe and debug multi-modal LLM applications end-to-end. Base64 encoded media is automatically handled by the SDKs across all integrations and SDKs, with no additional configuration required. You can also upload custom attachments or reference external media, with support for common formats like images (png, jpg, webp), audio files (mpeg, mp3, wav), and other attachments (pdf, plain text).\nSee the changelog for more details or watch the video above for a walkthrough.\n\ud83d\udcda Day 4: All new Datasets and Evaluations documentation\nToday we\u2019re highlighting documentation - an often overlooked but critical element of great Developer Experience. Alongside major updates to our Datasets and Evaluations features, we\u2019ve completely rebuilt their documentation to be more thorough and user-friendly than ever before. The new docs better explain how and when to use these features, introduce core data models, and provide end-to-end examples as Jupyter Notebooks. We\u2019ve also revamped the /docs\nstart page to reflect Langfuse\u2019s comprehensive platform scope, and added llms.txt\nfor better LLM tool integration. Documentation is product at Langfuse - we take it seriously and have built many features to help users get the most value from it.\nSee the changelog for more details. It also includes a summary of all the features we added to the documentation over the last year to make it truly awesome.\n\ud83e\uddea Day 5: Prompt Experiments\nPrompt Experiments are the final piece of the launch week theme of \u201cclosing the development loop\u201d. They allow you to test prompt versions from Langfuse Prompt Management on datasets of test inputs and expected outputs. You can optionally use LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators to automatically evaluate responses based on expected outputs, and compare results in the new side-by-side experiment comparison view. This powerful combination speeds up the feedback loop when working on prompts and prevents regressions when making rapid prompt changes\nSee the changelog for more details or watch the video above for a walkthrough.\n\ud83c\udf52 Extra Goodies\nList of additional features that were released this week:\nllms.txt\n: Easily use the Langfuse documentation in Cursor and other LLM editors via the newllms.txt\nfile./docs\n: New documentation start page with a simplified overview of all Langfuse features.- Self-hosted Pro Plan: Get access to additional features without the need for a sales call or enterprise pricing. All core Langfuse features are OSS without limitations, see comparison for more details.\n- Developer Preview of v3 (self-hosted): v3 is the biggest release in Langfuse history. After running large parts of it on Langfuse Cloud for a while, an initial developer preview for self-hosted users is now available.\nDon\u2019t Miss Out\nGitHub\n\u2b50\ufe0f Star us on GitHub & see all of our releases!\nChannels\nTwitter and LinkedIn will be our main channels for launching a new feature every day.\nYou can subscribe to our mailing list for daily updates:\nWednesday: Virtual Town Hall\nYou\u2019re invited to our virtual town hall where we\u2019ll demo the new features and discuss how they integrate into your development workflow. We will also answer your questions and talk about the future of Langfuse (especially v3).\n- When: Wednesday, November 20, 2024, at 10 am PT / 7pm CET\n- Where: https://lu.ma/c7zsbc3b\nNote: The recording of the town hall is now on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MzdiL9tUe0\nFriday: Product Hunt Launch\nWe are launching on Product Hunt for our third time on Friday, November 22nd.

"text": "LLM Product Development for Product Managers\nLearnings from working with hundreds of teams on how to build great AI products.\nThis blog post is loosely based on a conversation I had with Rina, Co-founder and CEO of Productside, who had some great questions from the PM perspective. Thank you, Rina, for having me on your podcast!\nIntroduction\nIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving technological landscape, product managers are increasingly tasked with incorporating AI into their products. While the allure of AI is strong, successful implementation requires careful consideration of use cases, quality metrics, and user experience. This guide draws from practical insights to help product managers navigate the complexities of AI product development, from initial prioritization to production deployment.\nPlease note that this is based on my experience working with hundreds of Langfuse customers and users. While I aim to generalize, I recognize that there are many other valuable use cases and best practices. Please reach out to me if you would like to discuss this further!\nSelecting the Right AI Use Cases\nThe foundation of successful AI product development lies in choosing the right problems to solve. Rather than chasing general capabilities that major AI companies will eventually solve, focus on specialized, domain-specific applications where your organization can provide unique value. When evaluating potential AI features, consider both risk and return - particularly in enterprise contexts where brand reputation or compliance/legal risks are at stake.\nGeneralizing a bit:\n- In internal tools, use cases that demonstrate greater efficiency and cost savings are usually prioritized, as these often have strong support from leadership\n- In customer-facing products, it\u2019s interesting to differentiate between automation and augmentation use cases. While augmentation can improve over time and build user trust, automation is typically easier to implement since it replaces manual workflows without requiring changes in user behavior\nBiggest Challenge: Good Requirements and Iteratively Improving Use Cases in Production\nA common challenge is that LLM use cases are often not well specified. This applies across use cases:\n- Chat applications are very open ended and it\u2019s hard to have a good understanding of all the different ways users will use the application\n- Agentic applications that augment/replace a human workflow have more edge cases than initially anticipated\n- Context retrieval/summarization suffers from context that is user-provided or changes over time\nUsually a very good approach is to:\nInitial dataset\nCreate a dataset of 50-200 examples that represent the production use case on a best effort basis.\nGold standard responses and evaluations\nCreate \u201cgold standard\u201d responses for each example and implement evaluation to be able to reliably compare a response to the gold standard.\nDefine target metrics\nSet expectations with stakeholders on how good the responses need to be to be considered acceptable for an initial beta/production release. The goal here is to be able to release the use case early and learn from production feedback.\nIterate against target metrics\nIterate on application in development to hit the target expectations.\nRelease to production\nRelease the use case to production and use production evaluation / monitoring techniques to identify edge cases on which the application does not meet the quality expectations\nClose the loop\nIteratively add these examples to the dataset to increasingly improve the quality of the performance benchmark used in development and make it more representative of the production use case\nEvaluations\nThis workflow requires a robust evaluation framework built on four pillars:\n- Implicit User Feedback is often overlooked although it helps capture production performance very effectively. It usually needs to be carefully designed as a part of the product UX. \u201cIf you build a customer success application and suggest a response to a user with an agent in the loop, if the agent doesn\u2019t edit the text and just hits send, that\u2019s probably good feedback, whereas if it\u2019s heavily edited, it\u2019s negative feedback.\u201d\n- Explicit User Feedback is simpler to implement as it only involves an explicit (\ud83d\udc4d/\ud83d\udc4e) button\n- Manual Expert Annotation is what most teams try to avoid as it\u2019s expensive and time-consuming. However, it\u2019s often the only way to get a true sense of quality while also being the benchmark for any automated evaluation\n- Automated Evaluations (like \u201cLLM as a Judge\u201d) helps scale out the evaluation process but usually needs lots of iterations\nImplementation Best Practices\n-\nDecouple Prompt Engineering from Development. Create separate workflows for prompt optimization and software development. This allows domain experts and product managers to iterate on prompts independently of engineering cycles. Some teams adopt a dedicated prompt engineering tool (e.g. Langfuse Prompt Management) for this.\n-\nDo not neglect Latency Optimization in favor of perfect accuracy. User experience significantly depends on response speed. Consider these strategies:\n- Optimize for fast initial token delivery so users see that something is happening\n- Implement engaging loading states\n- Pre-generate partial results where possible\n-\nDo not build workarounds for current model limitations. There are many issues that might limit the performance of an LLM application. Some of them will most likely be solved with future model releases, some are more specific to your use case. Generally it is advisable to focus most of the optimization efforts on the use-case related problems as these are the learnings that persist when new models are released.\n-\nDo not over-optimize on costs in the early stages of the product lifecycle. While cost concerns often dominate early discussions, they shouldn\u2019t overshadow value creation, especially in B2B contexts. Often the value to be created is much larger than the cost of the AI feature. Also, with new model releases, costs can go down significantly while the use case scales.\n-\nExplore different implementation strategies. There are many ways to implement an AI feature. When getting started, it is usually advisable to experiment with multiple different approaches to explore the space of possible solutions before optimizing a single approach for performance. This might otherwise lead to a local optimum. LLM application frameworks such as LangChain, Langgraph, or Llamaindex are a good starting point to explore different approaches and learn about the trade-offs.\nHow to learn more as a PM\n- Visit learnprompting.org/docs for prompt engineering fundamentals\n- We collected some good resources here: langfuse.com/library\n- Experiment with existing AI products to understand various UX patterns. Some core patterns emerge, and having a solid mental model of the different options is beneficial.\n- Study implementations in your domain. What went well? What are particular pitfalls that are unique to your use case?\n- It is highly recommended that you build your own prototypes, even as a non-technical PM. LLMs have made creating prototypes very accessible. Building with these tools will help you develop a good intuition for their capabilities and limitations. Many frameworks offer cookbooks and end-to-end examples that can be easily executed in platforms like Google Colab.\nConclusion\nSuccessful AI product management requires balancing technical capabilities with user needs while maintaining clear quality standards. By focusing on specialized use cases, implementing robust feedback loops, and planning for technological evolution, product managers can build AI features that deliver real value while minimizing risks.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192 Langfuse TypeScript SDK v4 is here \u2192"}, {"href":

to\nOpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to handle the instrumentation of applications for collecting traces, metrics, and logs. It helps developers monitor and troubleshoot complex systems by providing standardized tools and practices for data collection and analysis.\nOpenTelemetry supports various exporters and backends, making it flexible and adaptable to different environments. By using OpenTelemetry, applications can achieve better visibility into their operations, aiding in root cause analysis and performance optimization.\nGoal of this post\nThis post is a high-level overview of the challenges of LLM observability and the current state of using OpenTelemetry (OTel) for LLMOps.\nOTel is geared towards general observability, and traces are a great standardized way to capture LLM application data \u2013 we have recorded a webinar on this. While we are excited about OTel and the roadmap towards it across LLMOps tools, non-OTel LLMOps tools are preferred by many teams. This post explores why this is the case and how OTel can address these challenges in the future.\nExample trace of our public demo\nOutline\n- Overview of LLM Application Observability\n- Unique Challenges\n- Comparison with Traditional Observability\n- Experimentation vs. Production Monitoring\n- OpenTelemetry (OTel) for LLM Observability\n- Current State\n- My Personal View\n1. Overview of LLM Application Observability\nLLM Application Observability refers to the ability to monitor and understand how Large Language Model applications function, especially focusing on aspects like performance, reliability, and user interactions. This involves collecting and analyzing data such as traces, metrics, and logs to troubleshoot issues and optimize the application.\nUnique Challenges\nLLM applications present distinct challenges compared to traditional software systems. Evaluating the quality of LLM outputs is inherently complex due to their non-deterministic nature. Metrics like cost, latency, and quality must be balanced and cannot be purely derived from traces as they are in traditional applications.\nAdditionally, the interactive and context-sensitive nature of LLM tasks often requires real-time monitoring and rapid adaptation. Addressing these challenges demands robust tools and frameworks that can handle the dynamic and evolving nature of LLM applications.\nComparison with Traditional Observability\nTraditional observability focuses on identifying exceptions and compliance with expected behaviors. LLM observability, however, requires monitoring dynamic and stochastic outputs, making it harder to standardize and interpret.\nExperimentation vs. Production Monitoring\nIn development, experimentation with various models and configurations is crucial. Developers iterate on different approaches to fine-tune model behavior, optimize performance metrics, and explore new functionalities.\nProduction monitoring, however, shifts the focus to real-time performance tracking. It involves constant vigilance to ensure the application runs smoothly, identifying any latency issues, tracking costs, and integrating user interactions and feedback to continuously improve the application. Both phases are essential, but they have distinct objectives and methodologies geared towards pushing the boundaries of what the LLM can achieve and ensuring it operates reliably in real-world scenarios.\n2. OpenTelemetry (OTel) for LLM Observability\nCurrent State\nThe OpenTelemetry Special Interest Group (SIG) focused on \u201cGenerative AI Observability\u201d pushes for standardized semantic conventions for LLM/GenAI Applications and instrumentation libraries for the most popular model vendors and frameworks. Learn more about the SIG in its project doc and meeting notes.\nDeliverables of the working group (as of Oct 14, 2024) include:\nImmediate term:\n- Ship OTel instrumentation libraries for OpenAI (or any other GenAI client) in Python and JS following existing conventions\nMiddle term:\n- Ship OpenTelemetry (or native) instrumentations for popular GenAI client libraries in Python and JS covering chat calls\n- Evolve GenAI semantic conventions to cover other popular GenAI operations such as embeddings, image or audio generation\nAs a result, we should have feature parity with the instrumentations of existing GenAI Observability vendors for a set of client instrumentation libraries that all vendors can depend upon.\nLong term:\n- Implement instrumentations for GenAI orchestrators and GenAI frameworks for popular libraries in different languages\n- Evolve GenAI and other relevant conventions (DB) to cover complex multi-step scenarios such as RAG\n- Propose mature instrumentations to upstream libraries/frameworks\nCurrently, there\u2019s a mix of progress and ongoing challenges. Significant issues include dealing with large traces, diverse LLM schema implementations (often biased towards OpenAI), and capturing evaluations and annotations. Many OTel-based LLM instrumentation libraries don\u2019t strictly adhere to evolving conventions, resulting in vendor-specific solutions.\nMy Personal View\nDespite the challenges, I\u2019m excited about OTel instrumentation in the mid-term. The real value lies in its standardized data model, enabling seamless workflow integration across various frameworks and platforms. This standardization leads to increased interoperability across vendors, which is the main reason why OTel is interesting. Currently, we maintain countless integrations with popular models/frameworks/languages but can\u2019t support the long tail due to capacity constraints. Standardizing on OTel will allow the ecosystem to crowdsource instrumentation efforts, benefiting everyone and enabling LLMOps vendors to focus more on core features rather than maintaining numerous integrations. These developments are essential for achieving consistent and reliable observability across diverse LLM frameworks and platforms.\nWe are committed to OTel and are happy to contribute to the SIG. We will continue to maintain our integrations and SDKs and are currently exploring adding an OTel collector to allow for integrations with OTel-based instrumentation libraries.\nIf you are interested in contributing to our OTel efforts, join the GitHub Discussion thread.\nUpdate: We have released a Langfuse OTel Collector to increase compatibility with emerging OTel-based instrumentation libraries.\nGet Started\nIf you want to get started with tracing your AI applications with Langfuse today, check out our quickstart guide on how to use Langfuse with multiple LLM building frameworks

"Observability in Multi-Step LLM Systems - Langfuse Blog", "text": "Observability in Multi-Step LLM Systems\nOptimize multi-step LLM systems with advanced observability, feedback, and testing strategies for better performance and reliability.\nManaging the complexity of Large Language Model (LLM) applications requires a focus on maintaining high performance, reliability, and efficiency. As these apps become increasingly complex, they introduce multiple points of failure that can affect quality, cost, and latency.\nThis is where observability and traceability come into play. By implementing advanced techniques for monitoring and analyzing LLM systems, developers can gain deep insights into their applications, identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve their performance.\nThis post shows strategies to enhance traceability and observability in multi-step LLM systems, including the importance of observability, feedback collection methods, and rigorous application testing. These insights will help optimize LLM applications for better quality, cost-efficiency, and latency.\nTL;DR: Key takeaways include the necessity of observability in complexLLM systems to identify and resolve bottlenecks, enhance performance, and ensure reliability. Leveraging data and feedback, along with rigorous testing using \u201cgolden data,\u201d supports continuous improvement and optimization of these complex applications.\nWhy is Observability Crucial for Complex LLM Apps?\nAs these systems grow in sophistication, the potential points of failure multiply, impacting quality, cost, and latency. Without a robust observability framework, it becomes nearly impossible to identify and address these issues effectively.\nBy implementing comprehensive observability, developers gain real-time insights into the performance and behavior of their LLM applications. This enables them to pinpoint latency bottlenecks, understand the root causes of errors, and continuously refine their systems based on actionable data.\nMultiple Points of Failure\nIn a typical multi-step LLM application, various components interact to deliver a final output, such as:\n- Routing\n- Query extraction\n- Document retrieval\n- Summarization\n- Security checks\nEach step can become a bottleneck, affecting the overall performance. For example, a delay in query embedding can cascade, increasing the latency of the entire system.\nExample of a multi-step LLM application.\nGiven the intricate nature of multi-step LLM applications, continuous iteration and improvement are necessary. As new features are added and workloads change, developers must frequently revisit and refine their systems.\nThrough monitoring and analysis, developers can transform complex LLM systems into robust, high-performing applications.\nLeveraging Observability Data\nObservability data is not just about monitoring application performance; it\u2019s about gaining deeper insights that drive meaningful optimizations. By attaching rich metadata to observability data, developers can unlock information that enhances their understanding of how their LLM applications behave under various conditions.\nAttaching Metadata\nMetadata, such as user IDs, request contexts, and operational metrics adds valuable context to observability data. This enriched data allows for more granular analysis, enabling developers to correlate specific behaviors with user actions or system states.\nOptimization Efforts\nObservability data, enriched with metadata, provides a holistic view of the application\u2019s performance. This allows developers to:\n-\nIdentify Latency Bottlenecks: By analyzing trace data, developers can pinpoint specific steps that are causing delays and focus their optimization efforts there.\n-\nOptimize Quality: Detailed error metrics and user feedback data help in refining the application\u2019s response generation processes, reducing inaccuracies, and improving overall quality.\n-\nManage Costs: By understanding the resource consumption of each application component, developers can optimize their infrastructure usage, balancing performance and cost-effectiveness.\nIn essence, leveraging observability data with rich metadata transforms it from a simple monitoring tool into a powerful engine for continuous improvement.\nResolving Latency Bottlenecks\nIn multi-step LLM systems, latency bottlenecks can significantly degrade application performance, leading to slow response times and subpar user experience. Identifying and resolving these bottlenecks is crucial for maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of your LLM applications.\nTechniques to Spot Latency Bottlenecks\nExamples of Latency Impact\n-\nQuery Embedding Delays: If the embedding process for a user query takes too long, it can delay the entire response generation process, leading to slow response times.\n-\nDocument Retrieval Slowdowns: Slow retrieval of relevant documents can create a bottleneck, particularly in RAG (Relevance-Aware Generative) systems, where timely access to accurate information is critical.\n-\nInefficient Summarization: Delays in summarizing retrieved documents can add to the overall latency, affecting the application\u2019s ability to provide quick and concise responses.\nBy systematically identifying and addressing these latency bottlenecks, developers can enhance the performance of their LLM applications. Ensuring that each component of the application runs smoothly and efficiently will result in a more responsive and satisfying user experience.\nCollecting Feedback\nFeedback is essential for the continuous improvement of LLM applications. By systematically collecting and analyzing feedback, developers can make informed adjustments that enhance the performance and reliability of their systems. Here, we explore four effective methods for gathering feedback and discuss how to integrate this feedback into the development process.\nFour Types of Feedback\nSteps to Integrate Feedback\nCentralize Feedback Collection\nUse a unified platform to gather and store all types of feedback. This ensures that data is easily accessible for analysis and action.\nRegularly Review Feedback\nSchedule regular reviews of collected feedback to identify trends, recurring issues, and areas for improvement. This can be done weekly or bi-weekly, depending on the volume of feedback.\nPrioritize Feedback-Driven Actions\nPrioritize issues based on the impact and frequency of feedback. Address high-impact problems first to maximize the benefits of your improvements.\nIterative Development\nImplement changes iteratively, using feedback to guide each development cycle. After deploying updates, continue to collect and analyze feedback to assess the effectiveness of the changes.\nClose the Feedback Loop\nCommunicate back to users about the actions taken based on their feedback. This encourages ongoing participation and demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement.\nBy effectively collecting and utilizing feedback, developers can ensure that their LLM applications are constantly evolving to meet user needs and perform at their best. This improvement cycle is vital for maintaining the relevance and efficiency of complex LLM systems.\nTesting LLM Applications\nEffective testing is fundamental to the development and maintenance of robust LLM applications. One of the most reliable methods for testing these applications is by using datasets of expected inputs and outputs, often referred to as \u201cgolden data.\u201d\nThe Concept of \u201cGolden Data\u201d\nGolden data are curated datasets with known inputs and expected outputs, serving as benchmarks for LLM performance. By comparing actual outputs to expected results, developers can spot discrepancies and areas for improvement. This ensures consistent, reliable testing, preventing errors or performance degradation from updates.\nSteps for Creating Datasets\nDefine Test Scenarios\nIdentify the key scenarios and use cases that the LLM application needs to handle. These should cover a broad range of typical user interactions and edge cases.\nCurate Representative Data\nCollect a diverse set of inputs that reflect real-world usage. This can include historical data, synthetically generated inputs, and manually crafted test cases to cover specific edge cases.\nDetermine Expected Outputs\nFor each input, define the expected output. This may involve human annotation by experts or the use of predefined rules to generate the correct responses.\nOrganize and Label Data\nStructure the datasets in a clear and organized manner, labeling each input-output pair. Ensure that the data is easily accessible and well-documented.\nAutomate Testing\nImplement automated testing frameworks that can run the LLM application on the golden data. These frameworks should compare actual outputs against the expected results and generate detailed reports on any discrepancies.\nRegularly Update Datasets\nContinuously refine and expand the golden data to include new scenarios and use cases as the application evolves. Regular updates help maintain the relevance and accuracy of the testing process.\nSteps to use Test Results for Further Development\nAnalyze Test Results\nCarefully review the test results to identify patterns and recurring issues. Pay particular attention to areas where the actual outputs consistently deviate from the expected results.\nPrioritize Issues\nRank the identified issues based on their impact and frequency. Prioritize high-impact problems that affect critical functionality or user experience.\nImplement Improvements\nUse the insights gained from the test results to guide development efforts. Focus on resolving the identified issues and optimizing the application\u2019s performance.\nIterative Testing\nAfter implementing changes, run the application through the golden data again to verify that the issues have been resolved. This iterative process helps ensure that updates improve the application without introducing new problems.\nFeedback Integration\nCombine test results with feedback from users and other sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of the application\u2019s performance. This holistic approach ensures that improvements are aligned with user needs and expectations.\nBy testing LLM applications using golden data, developers can ensure that their systems meet high standards of accuracy and reliability. This methodical approach to testing not only helps in identifying and fixing issues but also drives continuous optimization, making the LLM applications more robust and effective over time.\nConclusion\nAs LLM applications continue to grow in complexity, the need for robust traceability and observability becomes ever more critical. Implementing these practices allows developers to gain deep insights into their systems, identify and resolve latency bottlenecks, and continuously improve the quality and performance of their applications.\nBy leveraging observability data and attaching metadata, developers can perform detailed analyses and make informed optimizations. Collecting and utilizing feedback through various methods\u2014explicit user feedback, implicit user feedback, human annotation, and automated evaluations\u2014provides a comprehensive understanding of the application\u2019s performance and areas for enhancement.\nAdditionally, testing LLM applications using datasets of expected inputs and outputs, or \u201cgolden data,\u201d ensures that changes and updates are thoroughly vetted for accuracy and reliability.\nGetting Started\nTo instrument your AI app and get started with observability, traceability, and experimentation, check out the

- Langfuse Blog", "text": "Should you use an LLM Proxy to Build your Application?\nLearn more about the pros and cons of using an LLM proxy.\nLLM Proxies are popular tools that add much functionality like caching, rate limiting, and routing to making LLM requests. This blog post will explain what a proxy is, what it does well and why ultimately we would recommend to think hard about using a proxy for your application.\nTLDR; Should you use an LLM Proxy?\nIn most production grade applications, the benefits do not outweigh the risks of using an LLM Proxy and thereby introducing a single point of failure. Thus, we purposefully built Langfuse to not act as an LLM Proxy, but rather as an asynchronous observability layer. This comes with the benefit of not limiting what you can observe (also non-LLM related).\nSometimes using a proxy is beneficial (see below); in these cases we recommend using LiteLLM which is open-source, can be self-hosted and has a first-class integration with Langfuse.\nWhat is an LLM Proxy?\nAn LLM Proxy is a service that sits between your application and the LLM provider\u2019s API. It intercepts the requests and responses, allowing for features like caching, rate limiting, and key management (more below).\nWhat is an LLM Proxy Useful For?\nThe great thing about LLM proxies is that they are very easy to implement. It usually simply requires changing the Base URL of the LLM provider in the SDK and opens up a range of features:\n- Caching: Store and reuse previous LLM responses to reduce API calls, costs and latency.\n- Rate limiting: Manage API request rates to avoid exceeding provider limits.\n- Unified API: Provide a consistent interface for multiple LLM providers, simplifying integration and provider switching (e.g. call all LLMs in the OpenAI format)\n- Request routing: Direct requests to specific model versions or providers based on predefined rules.\n- Cost management: Optimize spending by routing requests to cost-effective providers by use case.\n- Key Management: Manage API keys and secrets without exposing them to your application.\nWhat are the Downsides to Using an LLM Proxy?\n- Latency: Proxies can introduce additional latency to your application.\n- Reliability: Proxies can be a single point of failure in your system.\n- Security & Privacy: Proxies can introduce security risks if they are not properly configured.\n- Client-side timings: Proxies do not provide client-side timings.\nIs Langfuse an LLM Proxy?\nNo, Langfuse is not an LLM Proxy. Langfuse is an observability layer for your LLM applications that works asynchronously. This means that Langfuse does not sit between your application and the LLM provider\u2019s API, but rather observes and logs the interactions between your app and the LLM provider \u2018from the sidelines\u2019.\nOperating Langfuse as an asynchronous observability layer offers several advantages over functioning as a proxy:\n- Full Trace Logging: Langfuse allows for the logging of full traces, which are crucial for understanding the complete flow of requests and responses in your application. Traces help in identifying bottlenecks, debugging issues, and optimizing performance.\n- Inclusion of Non-LLM Call Spans: With Langfuse, you can add spans for non-LLM calls, such as retrieval operations, security screenings, and other auxiliary processes. These operations often have a significant impact on the overall latency and quality of the output, and including them in the trace provides a more comprehensive view of the application\u2019s performance.\n- No Added Latency: Since Langfuse operates asynchronously, it does not introduce any additional latency to your application\u2019s requests. This is a critical advantage, especially for applications where response time is crucial.\n- No Impact on Uptime: As an observability layer, Langfuse does not act as a single point of failure. It observes and logs interactions without affecting the uptime of your application, ensuring that your service remains reliable and available.\n- Client-Side Timings: Langfuse can capture client-side timings, providing insights into the performance from the user\u2019s perspective. This helps in understanding the end-to-end latency and improving the user experience.\nCan I use Langfuse with an LLM Proxy?\nYou can use Langfuse with LLM proxies. We recommend working with LiteLLM and using their integration with Langfuse for tracing.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript

Blog", "text": "Monitoring LLM Security in Langfuse\nHow to use Langfuse to trace, prevent, and evaluate security risks common to LLM-based applications.\nProtecting against security risks and attacks is becoming increasingly important for ensuring LLM apps are production-ready. Not only do LLM applications need to be secure to protect users\u2019 private and sensitive information, they also need ensure a level of quality and safety of responses to maintain product standards.\nThis post offers an overview of how you can use security tools in conjunction with Langfuse to monitor and protect against common security risks. The OWASP Top 10 list is a useful resource on the topic. It provides a consensus of the most critical security risks for LLM applications.\nIntroduction\nIn the video below, we walk through an example of how to use the open-source security library LLM Guard, and how to integrate Langfuse to monitor and protect against common security risks.\nHow to Monitor LLM Security\nLLM Security can be addressed with a combination of\n- LLM Security libraries for run-time security measures\n- Langfuse for the ex-post evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures\n1. Run-time security measures with LLM security libraries\nThere are several popular security libraries that can be used to mitigate security risks in LLM-based applications. These include: LLM Guard, Prompt Armor, NeMo Guardrails, Microsoft Azure AI Content Safety, Lakera. These libraries help with security measures in the following ways:\n- Catching and blocking a potentially harmful or inappropriate prompt before sending to the model\n- Redacting sensitive PII before being sending into the model and then un-redacting in the response\n- Evaluating prompts and completions on toxicity, relevance, or sensitive material at run-time and blocking the response if necessary\n2. Asynchronous monitoring and evaluation of security measures with Langfuse\nUse Langfuse tracing to gain visibility and confidence in each step of the security mechanism. These are common workflows:\n- Investigate security issues by manually inspect traces.\n- Monitor security scores over time in the Langfuse Dashboard.\n- Evaluate effectiveness of security measures. Integrating Langfuse scores into your team\u2019s workflow can help teams identify which security risks are most prevalent and build more robust tools around those specific issues. There are two main workflows to consider:\n- Annotations (in UI). If you establish a baseline by annotating a share of production traces, you can compare the security scores returned by the security tools with these annotations.\n- Automated evaluations. Langfuse\u2019s model-based evaluations will run asynchronously and can scan traces for things such as toxicity or sensitivity to flag potential risks and identify any gaps in your LLM security setup. Check out the docs to learn more about how to set up these evaluations.\n- Track latency to balance tradeoffs. Some LLM security checks need to be awaited before the model can be called, others block the response to the user. Thus they quickly are an essential driver of overall latency of an LLM application. Langfuse can help disect the latencies of these checks within a trace to understand whether the checks are worth the wait.\nExample Workflow: Anonymizing Personally Identifiable Information (PII)\nWe redact and un-redact sensitive information using a security library before and after it is fed into the model. We wrap the whole process with the Langfuse observe\ndecorator to trace and monitor the security process. In the following example below we use the open source library LLM Guard, an open-source security tool. All examples easily translate to other libraries.\nExposing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to models can pose security and privacy risks, such as violating contractual obligations or regulatory compliance requirements, or mitigating the risks of data leakage or a data breach.\nThe example below shows a simple application that summarizes a given court transcript. For privacy reasons, the application wants to anonymize PII before the information is fed into the model, and then un-redact the response to produce a coherent summary.\nThis is a Python example. It works similarly in other languages and can be traced via the Langfuse SDKs or API.\nInstall packages\npip install llm-guard langfuse openai\nFirst, import the security packages and Langfuse tools.\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners.anonymize_helpers import BERT_LARGE_NER_CONF\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai # OpenAI integration\nfrom langfuse import observe, langfuse\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\nAnonymize and deanonymize PII and trace with Langfuse\nWe break up each step of the process into its own function so we can track each step separately in Langfuse.\nBy decorating the functions with @observe()\n, we can trace each step of the process and monitor the risk scores returned by the security tools. This allows us to see how well the security tools are working and whether they are catching the PII as expected.\nvault = Vault()\n@observe()\ndef anonymize(input: str):\nscanner = Anonymize(vault, preamble=\"Insert before prompt\", allowed_names=[\"John Doe\"], hidden_names=[\"Test LLC\"],\nrecognizer_conf=BERT_LARGE_NER_CONF, language=\"en\")\nsanitized_prompt, is_valid, risk_score = scanner.scan(prompt)\nreturn sanitized_prompt\n@observe()\ndef deanonymize(sanitized_prompt: str, answer: str):\nscanner = Deanonymize(vault)\nsanitized_model_output, is_valid, risk_score = scanner.scan(sanitized_prompt, answer)\nreturn sanitized_model_output\nInstrument LLM call\nIn this example, we use the native OpenAI SDK integration, to instrument the LLM call. Thereby, we can automatically collect token counts, model parameters, and the exact prompt that was sent to the model.\nNote: Langfuse natively integrates with a number of frameworks (e.g. LlamaIndex, LangChain, Haystack, \u2026) and you can easily instrument any LLM via the SDKs.\n@observe()\ndef summarize_transcript(prompt: str):\nsanitized_prompt = anonymize(prompt)\nanswer = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmax_tokens=100,\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Summarize the given court transcript.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": sanitized_prompt}\n],\n).choices[0].message.content\nsanitized_model_output = deanonymize(sanitized_prompt, answer)\nreturn sanitized_model_output\nExecute the application\nRun the function. In this example, we input a section of a court transcript. Applications that handle sensitive information will often need to use anonymize and deanonymize functionality to comply with data privacy policies such as HIPAA or GDPR.\nprompt = \"\"\"\nPlaintiff, Jane Doe, by and through her attorneys, files this complaint\nagainst Defendant, Big Corporation, and alleges upon information and belief,\nexcept for those allegations pertaining to personal knowledge, that on or about\nJuly 15, 2023, at the Defendant's manufacturing facility located at 123 Industrial Way, Springfield, Illinois, Defendant negligently failed to maintain safe working conditions,\nleading to Plaintiff suffering severe and permanent injuries. As a direct and proximate\nresult of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff has endured significant physical pain, emotional distress, and financial hardship due to medical expenses and loss of income. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\n\"\"\"\nsummarize_transcript(prompt)\nInspect trace in Langfuse\nIn this trace (public link), we can see how the name of the plaintiff is anonymized before being sent to the model, and then un-redacted in the response.

"Haystack <> Langfuse Integration\nOSS observability and analytics for the popular RAG application framework.\nWe\u2019re excited to highlight a new Langfuse integration with Haystack!\nThis integration allows you to easily trace your Haystack pipelines in the Langfuse UI. We\u2019ve previously launched integrations with popular tools that devs love \u2014 including LlamaIndex, LangChain and LiteLLM \u2014 and we\u2019re excited to be continuing that with Haystack.\nThanks to the team at deepset for developing the integration. We\u2019re excited to see how you use it!\nWhat\u2019s New\nThe langfuse-haystack\npackage integrates tracing capabilities into Haystack (2.x) pipelines using Langfuse. You can then add LangfuseConnector\nas a tracer to automatically trace the operations and data flow within the pipeline.\nWhat is Haystack?\nHaystack is the open-source Python framework developed by deepset. Its modular design allows users to implement custom pipelines to build production-ready LLM applications, like retrieval-augmented generative (RAG) pipelines and state-of-the-art search systems. It integrates with Hugging Face Transformers, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic and others, making it an extremely popular framework for teams of all sizes.\nRAG has proven to be a pragmatic and efficient way of working with LLMs. The integration of custom data sources through RAG can significantly enhance the quality of an LLM\u2019s response, improving user experience. Haystack is a lightweight and powerful tool to build data-augmented LLM applications; you can read more about their approach to the building blocks of pipelines here.\nHaytsack recently introduced Haystack 2.0 with a new architecture and modular design. Building on top of Haystack makes applications easier to understand, maintain and extend.\nHow Can Langfuse Help?\nLangfuse tracing can be helpful for Haystack pipelines in the following ways:\n- Capture comprehensive details of each execution trace in a beautiful UI dashboard\n- Latency\n- Token usage\n- Cost\n- Scores\n- Capture the full context of the execution\n- Monitor and score traces\n- Build fine-tuning and testing datasets\nLangfuse integration with a tool like Haystack can help monitor model performance, can assist with pinpointing areas for improvement, or create datasets from your pipeline executions for fine-tuning and testing.\nOverview\nQuickstart\nHere are the steps to get started! First, add your API keys. You can find your Langfuse public and private keys on the dashboard. Make sure to set HAYSTACK_CONTENT_TRACING_ENABLED\nto \"True\"\n.\nimport os\n# Get keys for your project from the project settings page\n# https://cloud.langfuse.com\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\"] = \"pk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\"] = \"sk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_HOST\"] = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\" #

\"True\"\n# Your openai key\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-proj-...\"\nHere\u2019s how you add LangfuseConnector\nas a tracer to the pipeline:\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom haystack import Document, Pipeline\nfrom haystack.components.builders import PromptBuilder\nfrom haystack.components.embedders import SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder, SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder\nfrom haystack.components.generators import OpenAIGenerator\nfrom haystack.components.retrievers import InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever\nfrom haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore\nfrom haystack_integrations.components.connectors.langfuse import LangfuseConnector\nbasic_rag_pipeline = Pipeline()\n# Add components to your pipeline\nbasic_rag_pipeline.add_component(\"tracer\", LangfuseConnector(\"Basic RAG Pipeline\"))\nbasic_rag_pipeline.add_component(\n\"text_embedder\", SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder(model=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\n)\nbasic_rag_pipeline.add_component(\"retriever\", retriever)\nbasic_rag_pipeline.add_component(\"prompt_builder\", prompt_builder)\nbasic_rag_pipeline.add_component(\"llm\", OpenAIGenerator(model=\"gpt-4o\", generation_kwargs={\"n\": 2}))\nFor each trace, you can see:\n- Latency for each component of the pipeline\n- Input and output for each step\n- For generations, token usage and costs are automatically calculated.\nIf you want to learn more about traces and what they can do in Langfuse, read our

Engineering Platform - Langfuse Blog", "text": "Introducing Langfuse 2.0: The LLM Engineering Platform\nExtending Langfuse\u2019s core tracing with evaluations, prompt management, LLM playground and datasets.\nWe publicly launched Langfuse in late August of last year. Back then, the product was focused on production traces of LLM applications \u2013 because that was our main pain point when originally tinkering on code-generation and scraping agents.\nOur ambition was always to build open source tooling to help developers iterate on complex LLM workflows in production. In the meantime, we\u2019ve grown Langfuse from our first core users within YC to thousands of teams relying on Langfuse in startups and enterprises. Our feature scope now far exceeds observability \u2013 so it\u2019s time to launch Langfuse 2.0 \u2013 the LLM Engineering Platform.\nLangfuse\u2019s core is tracing. We provide an open source way to instrument, display and export complex traces of complex LLM applications, such as RAG or agent systems. We have invested heavily into the scalability and breadth of our integrations. We develop our own Python and Typescript SDKs and support integrations with Llama Index, Langchain, OpenAI, LiteLLM and others on top of this. Today you can use Langfuse with any popular model or framework via our SDKs and we\u2019ll continue to improve these as all of you add feature requests and report bugs.\nEvaluations are our largest feature addition. Today, we are releasing our eval service in public beta. It allows Langfuse users to run model-based evaluations on their traces. It\u2019s a shortcut to generating massive labeled datasets with little manual effort. You can of course still run custom evaluations or collect feedback from users and report these to Langfuse via our SDKs or API. We expect that the best teams will continue to experiment heavily with different evals, correlate with ground truths or manually labeled datasets to figure out how to reliably evaluate their application. We want to help with this.\nWhat are LLMs without Prompts? We have doubled down on helping developers manage their prompt workflows. You can now version prompts from within Langfuse\u2019s SDKs and UI. This is a huge unlock especially for teams with many domain experts or non-technical team members who rather manage and deploy prompts from Langfuse than in git. Prompt management hooks into Langfuse tracing to monitor how the versions of each prompt are used in production and you can easily roll back a change if you notice degraded performance.\nAnd since this week, you can also directly iterate on prompts within the new LLM playground. It is a neat and easy way to continue tinkering with the data you observe in Langfuse while not leaving the interface.\nOur most sophisticated users experiment and iterate on their entire LLM pipelines. This might start with a playground for some workflows, but our newly revamped Datasets feature helps do this on an ongoing basis with a structured evaluation process. Datasets are reference sets of inputs and expected outputs. You can upload your own datasets via the API and SDKs or continuously add to the datasets when recognizing new edge cases in production traces. You can then run experiments on these datasets and attach scores and evaluations to them.\nCrucially, as all features in Langfuse, this feature can be used via our powerful and open GET and POST APIs. We have seen users build some truly impressive workflows on top of this abstraction while being able to pick which pieces of Langfuse they want to use and where they built something specific for the unique workflow of their team. It\u2019s part of our commitment to building the most dev-friendly platform out there.\nWe can\u2019t wait to see what you build!\nPlease get in touch if you have feedback or questions, GitHub Discussions is the best channel to contribute your ideas to the project.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192

Langfuse Blog", "text": "Trace complex LLM applications with the Langfuse decorator (Python)\nWhen building RAG or agents, lots of LLM calls and non-LLM inputs feeds into the final output. The Langfuse decorator allows you to trace and evaluate holistically.\nNote: This blog post references our Python SDK v2. We have a new, improved SDK available based on OpenTelemetry. Please check out the SDK v3 for a more powerful and simpler to use SDK.\nWhen we initially built complex agents for web scraping and code generation while in Y Combinator, we quickly recognized the need for new LLM-focused observability to truly understand how our applications produced their outputs. It wasn\u2019t just about the LLM calls, but also the retrieval steps, chaining of separate calls, function calling, obtaining the right JSON output, and various API calls that the agents should perform behind the scenes. In the end, all these steps led to them breaking many times on our initial users.\nThis insight prompted us to start working on Langfuse. As many teams were experimenting, we prioritized easy integrations with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex, as well as wrapping the OpenAI SDK to log individual LLM calls. As applications become increasingly complex and agents are deployed in production, the ability to trace complex applications is even more crucial.\nTraces are at the core of the Langfuse platform. Until now, generating a trace was straightforward if you used a framework. However, if you didn\u2019t, you had to use the low-level SDKs to manually create and nest trace objects, which added verbose instrumentation code to a project. Inspired by the developer experience of tools we admire, such as Sentry and Modal, we created the @observe()\ndecorator for Langfuse to make tracing your Python code as simple as possible. Note: we plan to revamp our JS/TS tracing as well.\nThis post is a deep dive into the @observe()\ndecorator, our design objectives, challenges we faced when implementing it, and how it can help you trace complex LLM applications.\ntldr:\nIntroduction\nIn this video, we introduce the decorator and why we think it\u2019s an awesome abstraction to merge all Langfuse integrations. If you are familiar with it, skip this video and jump to the next section.\nGoals\nWhen starting to work on the decorator, we wanted to make everything simple that\u2019s complex when manually instrumenting your code. Consider this real-world trace of a complex agent, where maintaining the nesting hierarchy manually using the low-level SDK used to come with additional complexity and boilerplate code.\nExample of a nested trace with multiple LLM, non-LLM calls and a LangChain chain\nThe goal of the @observe()\ndecorator is to abstract away the complexity of creating and nesting traces and spans, and to make it easy to trace complex applications.\nThe decorator should:\n- Trace all function calls and their outputs in a single trace while maintaining the nesting hierarchy\n- Be easy to use and require minimal changes to your code\n- Automatically capture the function name, arguments, return value, streamed completions, exceptions, execution time, and nesting of functions\n- Be fully compatible with the native Langfuse integrations for LangChain, LlamaIndex, and the OpenAI SDK\n- Encourage reusable abstractions across an LLM-based application without needing to consider how to pass trace objects around\n- Support async environments for our many users that run performance-optimized LLM apps\nDesign decisions\n- The decorator reuses the low-level SDK to create traces and asynchronously batch them to the Langfuse API. This implementation was derived from the PostHog SDKs and is tested to have little to no impact on the performance of your application.\n- The decorator maintains a call stack internally that keeps track of nested function calls to reflect the observation hierarchy in the trace.\n- To be async-safe, the decorator leverages Python Contextvars for managing its state.\n- The same\nobserve()\ndecorator is used to create a trace (outermost decorated function) and to add spans to the trace (inner decorated functions). This way, functions can be used in multiple traces without needing to be strictly a \u201ctrace\u201d or a \u201cspan\u201d function.\nLimitation: Python Contextvars and ThreadPoolExecutors\nThe power of observability is most visible in complex applications with production workloads. Async and concurrent environments are common in these applications, and the decorator should work seamlessly in these environments. The decorator uses Python\u2019s contextvars\nto store the current trace context and to ensure that the observations are correctly associated with the current execution context. This allows you to use the decorator in reliably in async functions.\nHowever, an important exception are Python\u2019s ThreadPoolExecutors and ProcessPoolExecutors. The decorator will not work correctly in these environments, as the contextvars\nare not correctly copied to the new threads or processes. There is an existing issue in Python\u2019s standard library and a great explanation in the fastapi repo that discusses this limitation.\nIn short, the decorator will work correctly in async environments, but not in ThreadPoolExecutors or ProcessPoolExecutors.\nBefore and after\nStatus quo: Low-level SDK\nThe low-level SDK is very flexible but it is also very verbose and requires passing of Langfuse objects.\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai # OpenAI integration\nlangfuse = Langfuse()\ndef story(trace):\nspan = trace.span(name=\"story\")\noutput = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmax_tokens=100,\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a great storyteller.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away...\"}\n],\ntrace_id=trace.id,\nparent_observation_id=span.id\n).choices[0].message.content\nspan.end(output=output)\nreturn output\ndef main():\ntrace = langfuse.trace(\"main\")\nreturn story(trace)\n@observe()\ndecorator to the rescue\nAll complexity is abstracted away and you can focus on your business logic. The OpenAI SDK wrapper is aware that it is run within a decorated function and automatically adds its logs to the trace.\nfrom langfuse.decorators import observe\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai # OpenAI integration\n@observe()\ndef story():\nreturn openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmax_tokens=100,\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a great storyteller.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away...\"}\n],\n).choices[0].message.content\n@observe()\ndef main():\nreturn story()\nmain()\nInteroperability\nThe decorator completely replaces the need to use the low-level SDK. It allows for the creation and manipulation of traces, and you can add custom scores and evaluations to these traces as well. Have a look at the extensive documentation for more details.\nLangfuse is natively integrated with LangChain, LlamaIndex, and the OpenAI SDK and the decorator is fully compatible with these integrations. As a result, you can, in a single trace, use the decorator on the outermost function, decorate function calls and API calls that are non-LLM related, and use the native instrumentation for the OpenAI SDK, LangChain and Llama Index.\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nfrom langfuse.decorators import observe\n@observe()\ndef openai_fn(calc: str):\nres = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a very accurate calculator. You output only the result of the calculation.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": calc}],\n)\nreturn res.choices[0].message.content\n@observe()\ndef llama_index_fn(question: str):\n# Set callback manager for LlamaIndex, will apply to all LlamaIndex executions in this function\nlangfuse_handler = langfuse_context.get_current_llama_index_handler()\nSettings.callback_manager = CallbackManager([langfuse_handler])\n# Run application\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents([doc1,doc2])\nresponse = index.as_query_engine().query(question)\nreturn response\n@observe()\ndef langchain_fn(person: str):\n# Get Langchain Callback Handler scoped to the current trace context\nlangfuse_handler = langfuse_context.get_current_langchain_handler()\n# Pass handler to invoke method of chain/agent\nchain.invoke({\"person\": person}, config={\"callbacks\":[langfuse_handler]})\n@observe()\ndef main():\noutput_openai = openai_fn(\"5+7\")\noutput_llamaindex = llama_index_fn(\"What did he do growing up?\")\noutput_langchain = langchain_fn(\"Feynman\")\nreturn output_openai, output_llamaindex, output_langchain\nmain();\nOutlook\nThe decorator drives open tracing for teams that don\u2019t want to commit to a single application framework or ecosystem, but want to easily switch between frameworks while relying on Langfuse as a single platform for all experimentation, observability and evaluation needs.\nRoadmap: The decorator is currently only available for Python. We will add a similar implementation for JS/TS.\nAdd-on\nIf you want to built complex applications while being able to easily switch between models, we strongly recommend using this stack:\n- Langfuse Decorator for tracing\n- Langfuse OpenAI SDK Wrapper for automatic instrumentation of OpenAI calls\n- LiteLLM Proxy for standardization of 100+ models on the OpenAI API\nHave a look at this cookbook to see an end-to-end example \u2013 we really think you\u2019ll like this stack and there are lots of teams in the Langfuse Community who built on top of it.\nThank you\nThank you to everyone who tested the decorator during the beta phase and provided feedback. We\u2019ve received several Gists from community members showcasing their own decorator implementations built using Langfuse before the decorator was released as an official integration. We\u2019re excited to see what you create with it!\nGet Started\nRun the end-to-end cookbook on your Langfuse traces or learn more about model-based evals in Langfuse.", "links": [{"href":

{"url": "https://langfuse.com/blog/launch-week-1", "title": "Langfuse Launch Week #1 - Langfuse Blog", "text": "Joins us for Launch Week #1\nWe\u2019re excited to announce Langfuse\u2019s first launch week. We\u2019re kicking it off on Monday April 22nd and will release a major upgrade to the Langfuse platform every day until Friday.\n- \u2b50\ufe0f Star us on GitHub & see all of our releases!\n- Twitter will be our main channel for all of Launch Week #1\n- Join our first town hall on Wednesday\nLaunches\nDay 0: OpenAI JS SDK Integration\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \"langfuse\";\n// wrap the OpenAI SDK\nconst openai = observeOpenAI(new OpenAI());\n// use the OpenAI SDK as you normally would\nconst res = await openai.chat.completions.create({\nmessages: [{ role: \"system\", content: \"Tell me a story.\" }],\n});\nWe launched a new wrapper for the OpenAI JS SDK. This integration, designed to enable easier monitoring of OpenAI API usage, features seamless observability with enhancements like automatic tracking of prompts, completions, and API errors, as well as insights into model usage and costs. After a soft launch that gathered user feedback for improvements, the integration is now fully available, complete with comprehensive documentation and an example notebook.\nDay 1: PostHog Integration\nWe teamed up with PostHog (OSS product analytics) to integrate LLM-related product metrics into your existing PostHog dashboards. This integration is now available in public beta on Langfuse cloud. You can configure it within your Langfuse project settings. When activated, Langfuse sends metrics related to traces, generations, and scores to PostHog. You can then build custom dashboards to visualize the data or use the LLM Analytics dashboard template to get started quickly. See docs for more information.\nDay 2: LLM Playground\nWe\u2019re excited to introduce the LLM Playground to Langfuse. By making prompt engineering possible directly in Langfuse, we take another step in our mission to build a feature-complete LLM engineering platform that helps you along the full live cycle of your LLM application. With the LLM playground, you can now test and iterate your prompts directly in Langfuse. Either start from scratch or jump into the playground from an existing prompt in your project. See the docs for more details and let us know what you think in the GitHub discussion.\nDay 3: Decorator-based integration for Python\nWe\u2019re happy to share that the Decorator-based integration for Python now supports all Langfuse features and is the recommended way to use Langfuse in Python. The decorator makes integrating with Langfuse so much easier. Head over to the Python Decorator docs to learn more. All inputs, outputs, timings are captured automatically, and it works with all other Langfuse integrations (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI SDK, \u2026). To celebrate this milestone, we wrote a blog post on the technical details and created the example notebook shown in the video as it demonstrates what\u2019s really cool about the decorator. Thanks again to @lshalon and @AshisGhosh for your contributions to this!\nDay 4: Datasets v2\nWe\u2019re thrilled to release Datasets v2, featuring significant enhancements to the dataset experience in Langfuse. Improvements include a new editor powered by Codemirror, metadata support on all objects, tables that render inputs/outputs side-by-side, the ability to link dataset runs to traces, and the option to create dataset items directly from traces. We\u2019ve also extended the public API with new endpoints for programmatic management of datasets. Check out the changelog which summarizes all the new features and improvements.\nDay 5: Model-based Evaluations\nOn the final day of Launch Week 1, we\u2019re happy to release the biggest change to Langfuse yet: Model-based evaluations run right in Langfuse. So far, it was easy to measure LLM cost and latency in Langfuse. Quality is based on scores which can be user feedback, manual labeling results, or be ingested by evaluation pipelines that you built yourself using the Langfuse SDKs/API. Model-based Evaluations in Langfuse make it way easier to continuously evalutate your application on the dimensions you care about. These can be: hallucinations, toxicity, relevance, correctness, conciseness, and so much more. We provide you with some battle-tested templates to get you started, but you can also write your own templates to cover any niche use case that might be exclusive to your application. Check out the changelog or watch the video to learn more about all the details.\nLaunch Week Events\nWednesday: First virtual town hall\nYou\u2019re invited to our first virtual town hall. We (Max, Marc and Clemens) will be demoing new features in Langfuse, answering questions and talking about where we\u2019re taking the project. We\u2019re looking forward to hanging out!\n- When: Wednesday, April 24th, noon PT, 9pm CET\n- Recording on YouTube\nFriday: Langfuse 2.0 on Product Hunt\nWe will end the week with the launch of Langfuse 2.0 on Product Hunt on Friday, April 26th. After our initial launch last year \u2013 which led to a Golden Kitty Award \u2013 we are very excited to be back on Product Hunt.\nLaunch post (Spoiler: Langfuse became the #1 product of the day

Integration\nContext retrieval is a mainstay in LLM engineering. This latest integration brings Langfuse's observability to LlamaIndex applications for simple tracing, monitoring and evaluation of RAG applications.\nWe\u2019re launching our latest major integration with the LlamaIndex framework. LlamaIndex is a darling of our community. This integration has been our users\u2019 most requested feature for a while. We\u2019re thrilled to publicly release the integration after getting great feedback from our initial beta users. Thanks again to everyone who contributed to this.\n\ud83e\udd99 LlamaIndex, RAG and \ud83e\udea2 Langfuse\nLlamaIndex is a framework for augmenting LLMs with private data. The framework is extremely popular with developers (it is approaching 30k stars on GitHub) and is used across the space, from hobbyists to enterprises.\nLLMs are trained on huge datasets. Popular models such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT, Anthropic\u2019s Claude or Mistral are general purpose in nature. That is, they are not trained for a specific use case or context but to provide answers to any input that is provided to them. Retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) tries to steer Large Language Models towards a specific context again. By allowing the addition of private data sources and domain specific context to LLM apps, they can significantly enhance the quality of an LLM\u2019s response.\nRAG has proven to be a pragmatic and efficient way of working with LLMs. It is specifically suited to builders on the application layer, trying to tackle problems in a specific domain or context. It is already a much used technique in Langfuse user\u2019s projects and we\u2019re thrilled to more natively support its most popular framework.\nLlamaIndex completes our roster of major integrations next to existing integrations with OpenAI and LLM framework LangChain (see full list of integrations). We are committed to support the most popular ways developers build on top of LLMs and specifically to open source application frameworks.\nThanks again to the team at LlamaIndex for their guidance which helped make this integration feature rich and stable in record time.\nIntegrating Langfuse with LlamaIndex\nSince this post was written, we have released a new version of the LlamaIndex integration. Please check out the integration docs for the latest version.\nLangfuse integrates with LlamaIndex via its global callback manager. This makes getting set up as easy as adding the following few lines to your LlamaIndex app:\nfrom llama_index.core import Settings\nfrom llama_index.core.callbacks import CallbackManager\nfrom langfuse.llama_index import LlamaIndexCallbackHandler\nlangfuse_callback_handler = LlamaIndexCallbackHandler(\npublic_key=\"pk-lf-...\",\nsecret_key=\"sk-lf-...\",\nhost=\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\"\n)\nSettings.callback_manager = CallbackManager([langfuse_callback_handler])\nThat\u2019s it. Now your LlamaIndex app will automatically send detailed traces to Langfuse.\nWhile easy to set up, the integration makes extensive use of Langfuse Tracing to capture sessions, users, tags, versions, and additional metadata. Also, the integration is fully interoperable with the Langfuse Python SDK.\nUsers can naturally continue layering other Langfuse features such as evaluations, datasets or prompt management.", "links":

"Langfuse raises $4M\nWe're thrilled to announce that Langfuse has raised a $4m seed round from Lightspeed Venture Partners, La Famiglia and Y Combinator.\nWith Langfuse, we are building open source observability and product analytics for LLM-based applications. Our goal is to enable product and engineering teams to harness the power of Generative AI with the most useful and open suite of devtools focused on visibility and insights.\nWhen we first joined Y Combinator for the winter batch in early 2023, we iterated quickly on a number of LLM-native applications ranging from LLM-powered web-scraping \u2014 for research and go-to-market use cases \u2014 to generating engaging educational content on virtually any topic. All these applications shared a common trait: the excitement of early users (including us, of course) surrounding the initial demo and the technology\u2019s potential to solve problems that historically demanded extensive manual work or specialized model training.\nWhile the potential of LLMs to solve these problems was clear, we experienced the frustrating challenges of going from an impressive prototype to a reliable production-grade product. We quickly realized we weren\u2019t alone in facing those challenges! Many teams from startups to enterprises have done the work of identifying high-impact applications of GenAI for their internal workflows or consumer-facing products. Many also built POCs for the most promising ones. However, consumers often do not see these products as most teams are reluctant to push them into production due to a lack of visibility and trust in these stochastic/complex systems.\nWe took these first-hand learnings and began working on solutions. As engineers, we initially worked on a test framework to increase the confidence in application outputs while overcoming the problems when applying traditional CI frameworks \u2013 which are management of test set, latency and cost of running model-based evaluations in CI, and finding good evaluations in the first place. While this was a good contribution, we quickly realized that tests give a false sense of security as most teams have insufficient test data and evaluations which deviate a lot from the user experience in production. Thus, we built a first version of Langfuse focused on logging, debugging and analyzing LLM apps and tested it with other founders. After very positive initial feedback, we decided to open-source the project (repo) and became product of the day when launching on Product Hunt in August.\n\u201cWe were one of the first customers of Langfuse and it has really made our lives easier by meeting all our LLM analytics needs, allowing us to focus on building our product with great visibility on how it\u2019s used in production and how to best improve it. The team is super nice, responsive and dedicated to building the best observability and analytics solution. We\u2019re truly happy customers!\u201d\n\u2013 Yan Fu, Co-founder & CEO, Berry, AI-powered CSMs to automate SaaS onboarding\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used Langfuse since inception and it\u2019s been of great value while we scaled Alphawatch from POCs to production deployments at larger enterprises. It helped us to ship quickly, act on issues as they arise and saved us many hours of prompt and latency optimization.\u201d\n\u2013 Jackson Chen, Co-founder & CTO, Alphawatch, AI business automation for knowledge work\nChallenges of building LLM applications and how Langfuse helps\nIn implementing popular LLM use cases \u2013 such as retrieval augmented generation, agents using internal tools & APIs, or background extraction/classification jobs \u2013 developers face a unique set of challenges that is different from traditional software engineering:\nTracing & Control Flow: Many valuable LLM apps rely on complex, repeated, chained or agentic calls to a foundation model. This makes debugging these applications hard as it is difficult to pinpoint the root cause of an issue in an extended control flow.\nWith Langfuse, it is simple to capture the full context of an LLM application. Our client SDKs and integrations are model and framework agnostic and able to capture the full context of an execution. Users commonly track LLM inference, embedding retrieval, API usage and any other interaction with internal systems that helps pinpoint problems. Users of frameworks such as Langchain benefit from automated instrumentation, otherwise the SDKs offer an ergonomic way to define the steps to be tracked by Langfuse.\nOutput quality: In traditional software engineering, developers are used to testing for the absence of exceptions and compliance with test cases. LLM-based applications are non-deterministic and there rarely is a hard-and-fast standard to assess quality. Understanding the quality of an application, especially at scale, and what \u2018good\u2019 evaluation looks like is a main challenge. This problem is accelerated by changes to hosted models that are outside of the user\u2019s control.\nWith Langfuse, users can attach scores to production traces (or even sub-steps of them) to move closer to measuring quality. Depending on the use case, these can be based on model-based evaluations, user feedback, manual labeling or other e.g. implicit data signals. These metrics can then be used to monitor quality over time, by specific users, and versions/releases of the application when wanting to understand the impact of changes deployed to production.\nMixed intent: Many LLM apps do not tightly constrain user input. Conversational and agentic applications often contend with wildly varying inputs and user intent. This poses a challenge: teams build and test their app with their own mental model but real world users often have different goals and lead to many surprising and unexpected results.\nWith Langfuse, users can classify inputs as part of their application and ingest this additional context to later analyze their users behavior in-depth.\nWhy now\nObservability and monitoring may seem like very serious terms in an industry that is so nascent, but given the stakes for production-applications, companies shouldn\u2019t just \u201chope for the best and plan for the worst\u201d. Langfuse is here to help them \u201cplan for the best and mitigate the worst\u201d by providing the data architecture for the whole lifecycle of an LLM application.\nThe open data layer for the whole lifecycle\nLangfuse establishes an open-source data model to track all invocations throughout the lifecycle of an application. Thereby, teams have the full history to evaluate how usage patterns changed, new use cases emerged, and to understand the impact of new releases on production metrics. This data should not be in a closed ecosystem, but needs to be open. That\u2019s why all our SDKs, integration and application are open source under MIT license, simple to self host and have a GET API to reuse the data downstream (e.g. for usage based pricing based on token usage by customer).\nWe also deeply believe that there is a unique opportunity to build an integrated, yet independent open source data layer that helps teams switch models and application or evaluation frameworks for specific use cases. We are excited about all of our partnerships around integrations (LiteLLM, Flowise, Langflow) and evaluations (Ragas).\n\u201cWith RAGAS, we\u2019re running a popular open-source project focused on evals of RAG-applications. The Langfuse team has built a very generalized solution to effectively log LLM-based applications in production irrespective of the model or framework that\u2019s used. We are excited about our collaboration as it helps users to apply our RAGAS evals on production data to gain valuable insights over time.\u201d\n\u2013 Shahul Es, Founder, Ragas, evaluation framework for RAG applications\nWhere we are at\nSince the launch, we\u2019ve onboarded numerous teams onto our managed cloud and self-hosting offerings. We are especially excited that we hit a nerve with individual contributors in enterprises who host Langfuse to move fast with their applications while retaining ownership of sensitive production data. At the core, most users find a lot of value in debugging their complex application by inspecting a subset of problematic traces while having a high-level understanding of important metrics (cost, latency and overall quality).\n\u201cWhen it comes to productionising LLMs in the enterprise and especially in highly-regulated industries, Langfuse as one of the LLM monitoring solutions has been incredibly helpful to monitor user activity, solution performance and cost while being able to self-host strictly confidential data. Also, it is easy to evaluate our RAG application based on model-based evals and user feedback to quickly improve features in our product. More importantly, Langfuse is supported by a strong and highly responsive team of technical experts. I look forward to following the project and using it for more of my client projects!\u201d\n\u2013 Kai, Sr Software Engineer, BCG X\nWhat\u2019s next\nAfter having built the data and observability layer we close the loop and return to the problem of testing applications before they move to production. We aim to solve the problems we initially identified around selecting the best evaluations and maintaining a test set that is representative of production inputs. With Langfuse, users can quickly append new items to these test sets when identifying new edge cases in production.\nBased on the foundation of our existing observability stack, we are building out the leading open source LLM analytics platform. The job of our users is not easy as there is lots of short-term noise about frameworks, models, and emerging techniques for working with LLMs. These are exciting yet hard to navigate times. We aspire to guide developers with the right insights to make informed decisions grounded in real-world data, user feedback and evaluations.\nWe are open, the project is super easy to self-host, and you can try Langfuse Cloud without a credit card. Join us on Discord, give Langfuse a spin (sign-up), or try the live demo.\nThank you all!\nClemens, Max and Marc\nPS: If you\u2019re intrigued by solving some of the hard problems we\u2019ve laid out above, check out our open roles, we\u2019ll need smart and driven people on the journey alongside us!", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor":

October:\n-\nOpenAI SDK integration (Python)\n-\nCookbook for RAG evals based on Ragas\n-\n- SDKs expose trace URL\n- Python SDK now supports Pydantic v1 and v2\n-\n- Quickly page through traces\n- SSO via Google and GitHub\n- Delete projects\n-\nDocs improvements: Quickly open all Python docs as Jupyter notebooks\n\u2026 and many small improvements and bug fixes.\nThe details \ud83d\udc47\n\ud83d\udcc8 Enhancements to dashboard\nNow includes\n- Costs broken down by model\n- Latency percentiles by model (50th, 90th, 95th, 99th)\n- Usage/cost by end-user\n- Usage by trace type to break it down by application use case\n- New date-range selection\n\ud83e\udd16 OpenAI SDK integration\nDrop-in replacement for OpenAI\u2019s Python SDK to get full visibility by changing only one line of code. Automatically captures: prompts, completions, usage, latencies and API errors.\n- import openai\n+ from langfuse.openai import openai\n# Use OpenAI Python SDK as usual\nopenai.ChatCompletion.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a very accurate calculator. You output only the result of the calculation.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"1 + 1 = \"}],\n)\nThis integration fully supports grouping multiple requests into one trace if they belong to a single invocation. Also you can add scores to evaluate the outputs.\nSee integration docs for full details.\nThanks to @Dev-Khant for contributing to this.\n\ud83d\udcda Cookbook for RAG evals\nTogether with the Ragas team, we\u2019ve added a cookbook on how to evaluate production RAG (Retrieval augmented generation) pipelines in Langfuse. They specifically evaluate the retrieved context and the generated answer.\n\u26a1\ufe0f Doubled API performance\nAPI authentication previously added a significant overhead to API requests. We\u2019ve now optimized this and doubled the API performance.\n\ud83d\udc33 Simplified Docker deployments\nWe\u2019ve integrated the application of migrations to the startup process of the Docker image. This makes it much easier to deploy and continuously update Langfuse via Docker.\ndocker pull ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse:latest\nCheck self-hosting docs for full details on how to deploy Langfuse in a production environment.\nOptionally, you can also one-click deploy Langfuse to Railway:\n\ud83d\udee0 SDK improvements\nExpose Langfuse trace url\nIn some cases, it is useful to get the trace URL directly from the SDK to add it to your logs or print it in a development environment. This is now possible in all SDKs.\n# trace object\ntrace.get_trace_url()\n# Langchain callback handler\nhandler.get_trace_url()\nPython SDK now supports Pydantic v1 and v2\nThe Python SDK uses Pydantic to validate the data you send to Langfuse at run time before it is asynchronously sent to the Langfuse API. Previously, the Python SDK used Pydantic v1 leading to incompatibilities with projects using Pydantic v2.\nFrom 1.1.3\nonwards, the Python SDK supports both Pydantic v1 and v2.\n\ud83c\udfa8 UX improvements\nQuickly page through traces\nWhen you\u2019re browsing traces, you can now quickly page through them.\nUse the j\nand k\nkeys to navigate even faster.\nSign in via Google and GitHub\nYou can now authenticate using Google and GitHub. Also supported for self-hosted deployments. Check docs for details.\nDelete projects\nLong overdue, you can now get rid of old projects. Thanks to @DIWAKARKASHYAP for contributing to this.\n\ud83d\udcd6 Docs\n\u201cDocs is product\u201d\nAll Python docs are now Jupyter notebooks so you can quickly run them. They are in the cookbook folder of the Langfuse docs repo.\nWe\u2019ve added a banner to the docs to make it easy to open them on GitHub and Google Colab.\nExample pointing to new OpenAI integration\n\ud83d\udea2 What\u2019s Next?\nA lot is to come in November. For starters, we\u2019ll invest into the core user experience, especially to make working with complex traces easier.\nIf you have any feedback or feature requests on how to make Langfuse better for

Model-based evaluations via Python SDK\nWe\u2019ve added an example implementation on how to run model-based evaluations on production data in Langfuse using the Python SDK.\nThe new get_generations\nmethod allows you to fetch all generations based on a filter (e.g. name). You can then run your eval function on each generation and add the scores to Langfuse for exploration.\nWith this, you can run your favorite eval library (e.g. OpenAI evals, Langkit, Langchain) on all generations in Langfuse.\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nlangfuse = Langfuse(LF_PUBLIC_KEY, LF_SECRET_KEY)\ngenerations = langfuse.get_generations(name=\"my_generation_name\").data\nfor generation in generations:\n# import function from an eval library, see docs for details\neval = hallucination_eval(\ngeneration.prompt,\ngeneration.completion\n)\nlangfuse.score(\nname=\"hallucination\",\ntraceId=generation.trace_id,\nobservationId=generation.id,\nvalue=eval[\"score\"],\ncomment=eval['reasoning']\n)\n\u2192 Docs\n\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Datasets (beta)\nSystematically test new iterations of your LLM app with datasets\n.\nDatasets are collections of inputs and expected outputs that you can manage in Langfuse. Upload an existing dataset or create one based on production data (e.g. when discovering new edge cases).\nWhen combined with automated evals, Datasets in Langfuse make it easy to systematically evaluate new iterations of your LLM app.\nOverview of dataset runs on a demo dataset\nRun experiment on dataset\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\"<dataset_name>\")\nfor item in dataset.items:\n# execute application function and get Langfuse parent observation (span/generation/event)\n# output also returned as it is used to evaluate the run\ngeneration, output = my_llm_application.run(item.input)\n# link the execution trace to the dataset item and give it a run_name\nitem.link(generation, \"<run_name>\")\n# optionally, evaluate the output to compare different runs more easily\ngeneration.score(\nname=\"<example_eval>\",\n# any float value\nvalue=my_eval_fn(\nitem.input,\noutput,\nitem.expected_output\n)\n)\nDatasets are currently in beta on Langfuse Cloud as the API might still slightly change. If you\u2019d like to try it, let us know via the in-app chat.\n\u2192 Dataset docs \u2192 Python Cookbook\n\ud83d\udcca In-app dashboards\nOver the last weeks, analytics features were in public alpha on Langfuse Cloud. We\u2019ve now shipped a new query engine as an underlying abstraction for the native in-app dashboards. This is a major step towards bringing all analytics features into the Langfuse core project and helps us move much faster on these.\nOver the next days, you\u2019ll see more and more dashboards popping up in the app. If there is a specific analysis you\u2019d like to see, suggest it on Discord.\n\ud83d\udd04 New integrations\nThe new integrations make it easier to get started with Langfuse. Thanks to the teams behind Langflow, Flowise and LiteLLM for building/collaborating on these integrations.\nSee integrations docs for details:\n- Langflow: No-code LLM app builder in Python\n- Flowise: No-code LLM app builder in JS\n- LiteLLM: Python library to use any LLM model as drop in replacement of OpenAI API\n\ud83d\udd0e Complex filters for all tables\nYou can now filter all tables in Langfuse by multiple columns.\n\ud83c\udf10 Share traces via public link\nShare traces with anyone via public links. The other person doesn\u2019t need a Langfuse account to view the trace.\n\ud83d\udcbe Export generations (for fine-tuning)\nIn addition to the GET API, you can now directly export generations from the Langfuse UI. Supported formats: CSV, JSON, OpenAI-JSONL.\nUse Langfuse to capture high-quality production examples (e.g. from a larger model) and export them for fine-tuning.\n\ud83d\udea2 What\u2019s Next?\nThere is more coming in October. Stay tuned! Based on the new query engine we\u2019ll ship extensive dashboards over the next weeks. Anything you\u2019d like to see?

no-code in Langflow, observe and analyze in Langfuse\nLangflow provides a user interface that allows you to define LLM features and get started quickly. It offers a beautiful drag-and-drop UI that enables you to define complex chains of tools and LLM calls. This eliminates the need for coding everything from scratch and allows you to experiment and prototype effortlessly. With Langflow, you have the flexibility to choose different LLM Providers and a broad range of tools to enrich prompts. In addition to its user-friendly interface, Langflow also offers a community-provided set of pre-built LLM features. These features have produced good results for others, making it a great source of inspiration for your own projects.\nOnce you have set up your LLM feature chain using Langflow, it\u2019s time to test it in production. This is where Langfuse comes into play. Langfuse records all the steps of the LLM feature, allowing you to look into the details of how it behaved. It also provides analytics based on latency, API cost, and quality. Quality is measured by user feedback and model-based evaluations.\nSetting up both Langflow and Langfuse is easy. You can choose to self-host them or use the hosted version of Langfuse. The integration between the two tools is simple: just add the Langfuse environment variables when starting Langflow.\nexport LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>\nexport LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your public key>\nRead the integration docs for more details on how to set up the integration. If you are looking for a general intro to Langfuse, we recorded a 2 min demo showing the core tracing and analytics features.\nIf you want to learn more about Langflow and Langfuse, you can join their Discords for further discussions and support (Langfuse, Langflow). Additionally, as both projects are open source check out the open issues to collaborate with the community (Langfuse, Langflow) or leave a \u2b50\ufe0f.\nI love how Langflow makes it easy to build complex LLM applications and am super excited about this new integration (there will be more coming over the next weeks).", "links": [{"href":

everyone \ud83d\udc4b, over the last 4 weeks we doubled down on integrations, and pushing more trace context to Langfuse.\n-\nImproved ingestion of traces\n- Langchain integration for JS/TS users\n- Execute Langchain in the context of a Trace\n- Track releases and versions in Python and JS/TS\n- Improved filtering on Traces table\n-\nImproved Analytics\n- USD cost calculation for tokens\n- Token usage chart\n-\nOther\n- GET API: usage by user, model and date; access to raw traces\n- Simplified self-hosting via Docker\n\u2026 and many small improvements and bug fixes.\nThe details \ud83d\udc47\n\ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udd17 JS/TS Langchain integration\nLast month we released the Python Integration for Langchain and now shipped the same for teams building with JS/TS. We released a new package langfuse-langchain which exposes a CallbackHandler\nthat automatically traces your complex Langchain chains and agents. Simply pass it as a callback.\n// Initialize Langfuse handler\nimport CallbackHandler from \"langfuse-langchain\";\nconst handler = new CallbackHandler({\nsecretKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY, // sk-lf-...\npublicKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY, // pk-lf-...\n// options\n});\n// Setup Langchain\nimport { OpenAI } from \"langchain/llms/openai\";\nconst llm = new OpenAI();\n// Add Langfuse handler as callback\nconst res = await llm.call(\"<user-input>\", { callbacks: [handler] });\n\u26d3\ufe0f Langchain integrations with Trace context\nWhen using the Langchain Python integration, you can now add more context to the traces you create. Thereby you can add userIds, metadata or modify the id to be able to attach scores to the trace.\nimport uuid\nfrom langfuse.client import Langfuse\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\n# initialise langfuse client\nlangfuse = Langfuse(ENV_PUBLIC_KEY, ENV_SECRET_KEY, ENV_HOST)\n# create trace_id for future reference\ntrace_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n# create the Trace\ntrace = langfuse.trace(id=trace_id)\n# get a handler bound to the Trace\nhandler = trace.getNewHandler()\n# setup Langchain\nllm = OpenAI()\nchain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=PromptTemplate(...))\nchain.run(\"<your-input>\", callbacks=[handler])\n\u2192 Docs\n\ud83d\udce6 Trace context: Releases and versions\nWhen iterating quickly on an LLM app, understanding which change or release led to a certain behavior is crucial. Therefore we added the ability to add information on the releases and versions to traces and observations. This is helpful to understand which version of your app (e.g. git sha) or LLM feature (e.g. prompt version) was used in a given trace.\nReleases\nReleases are available for all SDKs. They can be added in three ways (in order of precedence):\n-\nSDK initialization\n# Python langfuse = Langfuse(ENV_PUBLIC_KEY, ENV_SECRET_KEY, ENV_HOST, release='ba7816b')\n// TypeScript langfuse = new Langfuse({ publicKey: ENV_PUBLIC_KEY, secretKey: ENV_SECRET_KEY, host: ENV_HOST, release: \"ba7816b\", });\n-\nVia environment variable\nLANGFUSE_RELEASE = \"ba7816b...\" # <- github sha or other identifier\n-\nAutomatically from a list of known release environment variables, e.g. Vercel, Heroku, Netlify. See the full list of support environment variables for JS/TS and Python.\nVersions\nWhen making changes to prompts and chains, you can add version\nparameter to span\n, generation\nor event\n. The version can then be used to understand the effect of changes using Langfuse analytics.\n\ud83d\udd0e Improved traces table\nOur users spend a lot of time on the Traces table to find the Traces they want to take a close look at. We added filtering options on metadata\nand userId\nto make navigating easier.\n\ud83d\udcc8 USD Cost Calculation\nWe\u2019ve added USD cost calculation for tokens. This is helpful to understand the cost of your LLM app per execution broken down by different LLM calls in the app. We calculate the cost based on the model and the number of tokens used.\n~~ Here is a list of all the models we support so far. If you are missing a model, please let us know on Discord. ~~ Update February 2024: Please refer to Model Usage and Cost for the latest info on how to calculate accurate costs.\nToken usage chart\nWe improved our analytics by creating a chart to the dashboard to visualize the token usage by model over time.\n\ud83d\udcca GET API\nBuild on top of the data in Langfuse using the new GET API\nUsage by user, model and date\nUse cases\n- Display usage in product\n- Integrate with billing system to charge users based on consumed tokens\n- Integrate with internal analytics system\nGET api/public/metrics/usage\n{\nid: userId,\nusage: [\n{day: <2023-08-01>\nmodel: claude-...,\npromptTokens: 6783,\ncompletionTokens: 5627,\ntotalTokens: 91738},]\n}\nOther usage APIs\nGET /api/public/users\nGET /api/public/metrics/usage\nGET /api/public/metrics/usage?group_by=trace_name\nRaw traces\nUse cases\n- Fine tuning\n- Metadata ingestion into data warehouse\nGET /api/public/traces\nGET /api/public/traces/:traceId\nGET /api/public/observations/:observationId\n\ud83d\udc33 Simplified self-hosting via Docker\nTo reduce the friction of self-hosting, we now publish Docker images for the Langfuse server. You can pull the latest image from GitHub Container Registry.\ndocker pull ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse\nFor detailed instructions, see self-hosting and local setup documentation.\n\ud83d\udea2 What\u2019s Next?\nThere is more coming in September. Stay tuned! We\u2019ll focus on shipping analytics to all users and further improvements to the UI/DX of the core platform. Anything you\u2019d like to see?

Update \u2014 July 2023\nBuilding out the core platform and preparing infrastructure for advanced analytics: Async SDKs, automated token counts, nested Trace UI, langchain integration, public GET API\nHi all, a lot has happened since our launch two weeks ago and I\u2019m excited to share our July update:\n- Faster integration\n- Langchain integration: Integrate with Langfuse in minutes when using Langchain\n- SDKs for Python and JS/TS: Now fully async, typed, and with improved DX for nested traces\n- New nested Trace UI\n- More metrics\n- Automated token counts for OpenAI and Anthropic models\n- Human-in-the-loop evaluation as an additional source of scores\n- Analytics\n- User reporting on token usage, traces and feedback\n- Analytics (alpha) continuously rolling out to more users\n- Other\n- Public GET API for custom integrations\n- Improved docs with new content and Q&A chatbot\nThe details \ud83d\udc47\n\ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udd17 Langchain Integration\nFor teams building their LLM app with Langchain, adopting Langfuse just got that much easier. We added a CallbackHandler\nto the Langfuse Python SDK that automatically traces your complex Langchain chains and agents. Simply pass it as a callback.\npip install langfuse\n# Initialize Langfuse handler\nfrom langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler\nlangfuse_handler = CallbackHandler(\nsecret_key=\"sk-lf-...\",\npublic_key=\"pk-lf-...\",\nhost=\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\", # \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa EU region\n# host=\"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\", # \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US region\n)\n# Your Langchain code\n# Add Langfuse handler as callback (classic and LCEL)\nchain.invoke({\"input\": \"<user_input>\"}, config={\"callbacks\": [langfuse_handler]})\nAlso works for run\nand predict\nmethods.\nchain.run(input=\"<user_input>\", callbacks=[langfuse_handler]) # Legacy\nconversation.predict(input=\"<user_input>\", callbacks=[langfuse_handler])\n\u26a1\ufe0f Improved SDKs for Python and JS/TS\nMost Langfuse users integrate using our Python or JS/TS SDKs. We made improvements to both DX and performance:\n- Fully async, avoid adding latency or blocking your app\n- Typed (Pydantic/Typescript)\n- Improved DX for nesting traces; no need to manually manage IDs\n- Support for more runtimes: JS/TS SDKs work in Node.js, Edge (Deno, Vercel, Cloudflare) or in the browser to directly report scores (e.g. user feedback) to Langfuse\n\u2192 SDK docs\n\u26d3\ufe0f New Trace UI\nMost users of Langfuse run complex LLM-based applications. To help monitor and debug these applications and understand how the different steps lead to the final output, we added a new nested trace UI.\nExamples from our Langchain integration:\n\ud83e\uddee Automated Token Counts\nUsage/cost reporting is a key use case of Langfuse.\nUntil now, token counts needed to be ingested when logging new LLM calls. For OpenAI and Anthropic models, Langfuse now automatically calculates token counts based on the ingested prompts and completions. This is helpful as some APIs do not provide token counts in their responses. It also reduces integration effort.\n\ud83c\udf1f Human-in-the-loop Evaluation\nScores in Langfuse are essential to monitor the quality of your LLM app. Until now, scores were created via the Web SDK based on user feedback (e.g. thumbs up/down, implicit user feedback) or via the API (e.g. when running model-based evals).\nMany of you wanted to annotate generations in the UI as you or your team browse production logs. We\u2019ve added this to the Langfuse UI:\n\ud83d\udc65 User Reporting\nAdd a userId\nwhen ingesting data into Langfuse and use it to get usage/cost broken down by user. Explore what individual users are doing in your LLM app.\nMore user-based analytics and features are coming soon, e.g. APIs to use this data in your own dashboards and usage-based billing.\n\ud83d\udcc8 Analytics (alpha)\nCurrently we are working with a small group of alpha users to test our analytics features. We\u2019ve focused a lot on getting this right and are excited to share more soon. Reach out if you want to share your needs or want to be part of the alpha. We are onboarding new users every week.\n\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udcbb Public GET API\nWe added a public GET API to Langfuse to support users consuming Langfuse data in their own applications. Check out the API reference for more details on the available endpoints. Need other endpoints? Shoot me a message: [email protected]\nExample use cases:\n- Integrate user feedback (by use case) into your own dashboards\n- Fine-tune on low-quality generations\nGET /traces\nGET /traces/:traceId\nGET /scores\nGET /observations/:observationId\n\ud83d\udcda Improved Docs\nWe\u2019ve shipped a lot over the last month and the docs were lagging behind. We\u2019ve now updated the docs to reflect the latest changes and added a bunch of new content. This should make it way easier to get started with Langfuse and incrementally adopt more advanced features. We\u2019d love to get your feedback on the docs, use the new widget on the bottom to \ud83d\udc4d/\ud83d\udc4e, thank you \ud83d\ude4f\nWe also added a Q&A chatbot as one user was surprised that we don\u2019t have one yet. It\u2019s still a bit rough around the edges but we\u2019ll improve it over time. Give feedback when using it and you can be sure that it is all tracked and analyzed in Langfuse.\n\ud83d\udea2 What\u2019s Next?\nThere is more coming in August. Stay tuned! We\u2019ll focus on shipping analytics to all users and further improvements to the UI/DX of the core platform. Anything you\u2019d like to see?

- Langfuse Blog", "text": "Q&A Chatbot for the Langfuse Docs\nSummary of how we've built a Q&A chatbot for the Langfuse docs and how Langfuse helps us to improve it\nWe\u2019ve built a new Q&A chatbot to help users find the right information in the Langfuse docs. In this post, I\u2019ll briefly summarize how we\u2019ve built it and how we use Langfuse to monitor and improve it.\nUpdate: All Langfuse Cloud users now have view-only access to this project. View live demo to explore it yourself.\n\ud83d\udc4b Do you have any questions about Langfuse? Ask me!\n\u26a0\ufe0f Warning: Do not enter sensitive information. All chat messages can be viewed in the public demo project. Responses may be inaccurate. Please check the documentation for details or reach out to us via the chat widget.\nImplementation\nTechnologies used\n- Embeddings of docs (.mdx files)\n- Model: OpenAI\ntext-embedding-ada-002\n- GitHub Action workflow to update embeddings on cron schedule: supabase/embeddings-generator\n- Storage\n- Postgres with pgvector: Supabase\n- Schema: supabase/headless-vector-search\n- Model: OpenAI\n- Streaming responses\n- Model: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo\n- Retrieval (embedding similarity search functions): supabase/headless-vector-search\n- Next.js edge function using Vercel AI SDK\n- UI components with streaming and markdown support: ai-chatbot\n- Observability, analytics and feedback collection: Langfuse, integrated via Typescript SDK (edge & web)\nCode\nAll of the code is open source and available on GitHub in the langfuse-docs repo. Relevant files:\n- generate_embeddings.yml\n- index.tsx\n- qa-chatbot.ts\n- qa-chatbot.mdx\nLangfuse\nWant to explore the project in Langfuse yourself? Create account to get view-only access to this project in Langfuse.\nUsage reporting\nThe reporting helps us to:\n- Monitor usage (cost control)\n- Understand what new users of Langfuse want to know which helps us to improve the docs\n- Track latency, quality (based on user feedback) and OpenAI errors\nTracing\nEach response is based on the following steps which can go wrong, be slow or expensive:\n- Embedding of user request\n- Embedding similarity search in Postgres\n- Summary of docs as markdown\n- Generation of response based on retrieved context and chat history\nThis is how a single trace looks like in Langfuse:\nUser feedback collection\nIn this example, we can see how we do:\n- Collection of feedback using the Langfuse Web SDK\nNegative, Langchain not included in response\n- Browsing of feedback\n- Identification of the root cause of the low-quality response\nDocs on Langchain integration are not included in embedding similarity search\nWhy build this?\nA user was surprised when I (a human) answered his/her question. It\u2019s 2023, a bot was expected. As we added a lot to the docs over the last days, building a retrieval-based chatbot finally made sense to help users explore the project. Also, I love to have an additional production app to dogfood new Langfuse features and demonstrate how Langfuse can be used.\nGet in touch\nWe\u2019re super excited to offer users of the Langfuse docs a faster way to find the right information and dogfood Langfuse to monitor it. Check out the repo for all backend and frontend code including the integration with Langfuse.\nIf you have any questions, join the Discord or reach out to me on Twitter.", "links": [{"href":

most common interface for LLM apps. This showcase is a reference implementation on how to integrate Langfuse with chatbots using the Langfuse Typescript SDK.\nDemo\nFrontend: chat.langfuse.com\nChat application with conversations, user feedback, and streaming responses from the edge.\nLangfuse UI\nWe have captured threads of users as single traces in langfuse. Threads include the user_id, overall token usage, and further metadata. User feedback which is collected in the frontend is directly related to the trace and helps to find low-quality conversations and individual messages which got negative feedback.\nHighlights of the integration\n- Model agnostic\n- Typescript SDK can be used in edge runtimes and in the frontend as it uses the\nfetch\nAPI - Tracing of streaming responses\n- Fully asynchronous, adds minimal latency and does not throw errors in the main thread\n- User feedback collected in frontend with optional comments on individual messages\nChatbot\nWe integrated Langfuse into the ai-chatbot template which was open sourced by the Vercel AI team. The template uses (from Readme):\n- Next.js (App Router)\n- Vercel AI SDK for streaming chat UI\n- OpenAI\n- Edge runtime\n- Chat History, rate limiting, and session storage with Vercel KV\n- NextAuth.js for authentication\nIntegration\nThe fully integrated showcase is available on GitHub if you are interested: langfuse/ai-chatbot\nBackend\nWe demonstrate the integration via the Langfuse Typescript SDK in app/api/chat/route.ts. This API route handles the streaming response from OpenAI using the Vercel AI SDK and saves the chat history in Vercel KV.\nUsing Langchain? Read the Langchain Integration announcement to skip the details and integrate in seconds.\nAdd SDK\nnpm i langfuse\nInitialize client\nconst langfuse = new Langfuse({\nsecretKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY,\npublicKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,\n});\nGrouping conversation as trace in Langfuse\nconst trace = langfuse.trace({\nname: \"chat\",\nid: `chat:${chatId}`,\nmetadata: {\nuserEmail,\n},\nuserId: `user:${userId}`,\n});\n- We use the existing\nchatId\nas theid\nof the trace. This allows us to group all messages of a conversation into a single trace. For traces, the Langfuse SDK upserts the trace based on the providedid\n. This means that we can calltrace()\non every new message in a conversation. - We add the\nuserId\nas it allows us to filter and aggregate data in Langfuse based on users for debugging and analytics. - In\nmetadata\nwe can add any additional information that we want to be available in Langfuse. In this example, we add theuserEmail\n.\nCreating the LLM call\nBefore starting the LLM call, we create a generation object in Langfuse. This sets the start_time used for latency analysis in Langfuse, configures the generation object (e.g. which tokenizer to use to estimate token amounts), and provides us with the generation_id\nwhich we need to use in the frontend to log user feedback.\nconst lfGeneration = trace.generation({\nname: \"chat\",\ninput: openAiMessages,\nmodel: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\nmodelParameters: {\ntemperature: 0.7,\n},\n});\nUpdating the LLM call\nThanks to the Vercel AI SDK, we can use the onStart\nand onCompletion\ncallbacks to update/end the generation object in Langfuse.\n// once streaming started\nasync onStart() {\nlfGeneration.update({\ncompletionStartTime: new Date()\n})\n}\n// once streaming completed\nasync onCompletion(completion) {\nlfGeneration.end({\noutput: completion\n})\n}\nAdd generation_id to streaming response\nThe simplest way to provide the generation_id\nto the frontend when using streaming responses is to add it as a custom header. This id is required to log user feedback in the frontend and relate it to the individual message.\nreturn new StreamingTextResponse(stream, {\nheaders: {\n\"X-Message-Id\": lfGeneration.id,\n},\n});\nBonus: Add debug events\nThe ai-chatbot uses Vercel-KV to store the chat history. We can add debug events to the generation object to track the usage of the KV store.\nlfGeneration.event({\nname: \"kv-hmset\",\nlevel: \"DEBUG\",\ninput: {\nkey: `chat:${chatId}`,\n...payload,\n},\n});\nlfGeneration.event({\nname: 'kv-zadd',\n...\n}):\nFrontend\nIn the frontend, we want to capture user feedback (positive/negative + comment) on a per-message basis. Find the full source code here:components/chat-message-actions.tsx\nFeedback modal:\nInitialize client\nWe use the Langfuse Typescript SDK directly in the frontend to log the user feedback to Langfuse.\nThe SDK requires the publicKey\nwhich can be safely exposed as it can only be used to log user feedback.\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseWeb({\npublicKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY ?? \"\",\n});\nLog user feedback\nWe created an event handler for the feedback form. The feedback is then logged as a score in Langfuse. We need to provide two ids to langfuse.score()\nto relate the feedback to the individual message:\ntraceId\n, which is the unique identifier of the conversation thread. As in the backend, we use thechatId\nwhich is the same for all messages in a conversation and already available in the frontend.observationId\nwhich is the unique identifier of the observation within the trace that we want to relate the feedback to. In this case we made the langfusegeneration.id\n(from the backend) in the backend available as themessage.id\n(in the frontend). For details on how we captured the custom streaming response header which included the id, see components/chat.tsx.\nawait langfuse.score({\ntraceId: `chat:${chatId}`,\nobservationId: message.id,\nname: \"user-feedback\",\nvalue: modalState.feedback === \"positive\" ? 1 : -1,\ncomment: modalState.comment,\n});\nNext steps\nIf you want to integrate Langfuse into your own chat application, read the Quickstart for an overview and the SDK documentation for more implementation details.\nGet in touch\nLangfuse is being actively developed in open source together with the community.

\u2018Mixpanel\u2019) for LLM apps. We help companies to track and analyze quality, cost and latency across product releases and use cases.\nHi everyone,\nwe\u2019re Max, Marc and Clemens. We were part of the Winter 23 batch and work on Langfuse, where we help teams make sense of how their LLM applications perform.\n\ud83e\udd2f Problem\nLLMs represent a new paradigm in software. Single LLM calls are probabilistic and add substantial latency and cost. Applications use LLMs in new ways via advanced prompting, embedding-based retrieval, chains, and agents with tools. Teams building production-grade LLM applications have new product analytics and monitoring needs:\n- Quality of outputs is difficult to measure. Outputs can e.g. be inaccurate, unhelpful, poorly formatted, hallucinated or error.\n- Cost of compute is a priority again given high inference costs.\n- Latency of responses matters for synchronous use cases.\n- Debugging is challenging due to increasingly complex LLM applications (chains, agents, tool usage).\n- Understanding user behavior is difficult given open-ended user prompts and conversational interactions.\n\ud83e\udde0 Solution\nLangfuse derives actionable insights from production data. Our customers use Langfuse to answer questions such as: \u201cHow helpful are my LLM app\u2019s outputs? What is my LLM API spend by customer? What do latencies look like across geographies and steps of LLM chains? Did the quality of the application improve in newer versions? What was the impact of switching from zero-shotting GPT4 to using few-shotted Llama calls?\u201d\nMetrics\n- Quality is measured through user feedback, model-based scoring and human-in-the-loop scored samples. Quality is assessed over time as well as across prompt versions, LLMs and users.\n- Cost and Latency are accurately measured and broken down by user, session, geography, feature, model and prompt version.\nInsights\n- Monitor quality/cost/latency tradeoffs by release to facilitate product and engineering decisions.\n- Cluster use cases by employing a classifier to understand what users are doing.\n- Break down LLM usage by customer for usage-based billing and profitability analysis.\nIntegrations\n- Python and Typescript SDKs to easily monitor complex LLM apps\n- Frontend SDK to directly capture feedback from users as a quality signal\nLangfuse can be self-hosted or used with a generous free tier in our managed cloud version.\n\ud83d\udea7 Debugging UI\nBased on the ingested data, Langfuse helps developers debug complex LLM apps in production:\n- Inspect LLM app executions in a nested UI for chains, agents and tool usage.\n- Segment by user feedback to find the root cause of quality problems.\n\ud83d\ude4f Asks\n- Star us on GitHub + follow along on Twitter & LinkedIn.\n- If you run an LLM app, go ahead and reach out to us, we\u2019d love to see how we can be helpful.\n- Please forward Langfuse to teams building commercial LLM applications.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4

Overview\nEvaluation is a critical aspect of developing and deploying LLM applications. Usually, teams use a multitude of different evaluation methods to score the performance of their AI application depending on the use case and the stage of the development process.\nWatch this walkthrough of Langfuse Evaluation and how to use it to improve your LLM application.\nWhy use LLM Evaluation?\nLLM evaluation is crucial for improving the accuracy and robustness of language models, ultimately enhancing the user experience and trust in your AI application. Here are the key benefits:\n- Quality Assurance: Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\n- Performance Monitoring: Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\n- Continuous Improvement: Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\n- User Trust: Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic evaluation\n- Risk Mitigation: Catch potential issues before they reach production users, reducing the likelihood of poor user experiences or reputational damage\nOnline & Offline Evaluation\nOffline Evaluation involves\n- Evaluating the application in a controlled setting\n- Typically using curated test Datasets instead of live user queries\n- Heavily used during development (can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to measure improvements / regressions\n- Repeatable and you can get clear accuracy metrics since you have ground truth.\nOnline Evaluation involves\n- Evaluating the application in a live, real-world environment, i.e. during actual usage in production.\n- Use Evaluation Methods that track success rates, user satisfaction scores, or other metrics on live traffic\n- Advantage of online evaluation is that it captures things you might not anticipate in a lab setting\n- Can include collecting implicit and explicit user feedback, and possibly running shadow tests or A/B tests\nIn practice, successful evaluation blends online and offline evaluations. Many teams adopt a loop-like approach. This way, evaluation is continuous and ever-improving.\nAdapted from: \u201cHow to continuously improve LLM products?\u201d, Evidently\nCore Concepts\nEvaluation Methods\nEvaluation methods are functions or tools to assign evaluation Score\ns to other objects. Langfuse uses the Scores to store evaluation metrics, it is meant to be flexible to represent any evaluation metric.\nLangfuse currently supports: automatic scoring through LLM-as-a-Judge, manual Human Annotations or fully Custom Scoring via API/SDKs. We keep adding more evaluation methods fast, so stay tuned!\nLearn more about the Scores Data Model.\nDataset Runs\nDataset Runs are used to loop your LLM application through Datasets and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results. This lets you strategically evaluate your application and compare the performance of different inputs, prompts, models, or other parameters side-by-side against controlled conditions.\nIn Langfuse we differentiate between Native vs. Remote Dataset Runs. Native Dataset Runs rely on Dataset, Prompts and optionally LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluators all being on the Langfuse platform. Remote Dataset Runs rely only on Datasets being on the Langfuse platform, prompts and evaluation methods can be managed off platform \u2013 they are run via code.\nAll require managing the Datasets on the Langfuse platform.\nLearn more about the Dataset Runs Data Model.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192

Annotation\nHuman Annotation is a manual evaluation method. It is used to collaboratively annotate traces, sessions and observations with scores.\nIn Langfuse you can use Annotation Queues to streamline working through reviewing larger batches of of single interactions (trace-level), multiple interactions (session-level) or even single observations, below the trace level.\nWhy use Human Annotation?\n- Collaboration: Enable team collaboration by inviting other internal members to annotate a subset of traces and observations. This manual evaluation can enhance the overall accuracy and reliability of your results by incorporating diverse perspectives and expertise.\n- Annotation data consistency: Create score configurations for annotation workflows to ensure that all team members are using standardized scoring criteria. Hereby configure categorical, numerical or binary score types to capture different aspects of your data.\n- Evaluation of new product features: This feature can be useful for new use cases where no other scores have been allocated yet.\n- Benchmarking of other scores: Establish a human baseline score that can be used as a benchmark to compare and evaluate other scores. This can provide a clear standard of reference and enhance the objectivity of your performance evaluations.\nAnnotation of Single Traces, Sessions and Observations\nHuman Annotation of single traces, sessions and observations is available in the trace, session and observation detail view.\nPrerequisite: Create a Score Config\nTo use Human Annotation, you need to have at least one score configuration (Score Config) set up. See how to create and manage Score Configs for details.\nTrigger Annotation on a Trace, Session or Observation\nOn a Trace, Session or Observation detail view click on Annotate\nto open the annotation form.\nSelect Score Configs to use\nSet Score values\nSee newly added Scores\nTo see your newly added scores on traces or observations, click on the Scores\ntab on the trace or observation detail view.\nTo see your newly added scores on sessions, click on the Scores\ntab on the session detail view.\nAll scores are also available in the traces, sessions and observations table views respectively.\nAnnotation Queues\nAnnotation queues allow you to manage and prioritize your annotation tasks in a structured way. This feature is particularly useful for large-scale projects that benefit of human-in-the-loop evaluation at some scale. Queues streamline this process by allowing for specifying which traces, sessions or observations you\u2019d like to annotate on which dimensions.\nCreate Annotation Queues\nPrerequisite: Create a Score Config\nTo use Human Annotation, you need to have at least one score configuration (Score Config) set up. See how to create and manage Score Configs for details.\nGo to Annotation Queues View\n- Navigate to\nYour Project\n>Human Annotation\nto see all your annotation queues. - Click on\nNew queue\nto create a new queue.\nFill out Create Queue Form\n- Select the\nScore Configs\nyou want to use for this queue. - Set the\nQueue name\nandDescription\n(optional).\n- Click on\nCreate queue\nto create the queue.\nAssign Users to Annotation Queues\nGo to Annotation Queues View\n- Navigate to\nYour Project\n>Human Annotation\nto see all your annotation queues. - Click on\nNew queue\nto assign users to a new queue or click the three dots on the right of an existing queue to assign users to it.\nAssign Users to the Queue\n- Expand the\nUser Assignment\nsection under theAdvanced settings\nsection. - Search for the users you want to assign to the queue.\n- Click on the user to assign them to the queue. You can also assign multiple users at once by selecting them in the search results.\n- Review the users you have selected to be assigned to the queue.\n- Click on\nSave\nto save the queue.\nManage Assignments\n- Click on the three dots on the right of the queue or the\nEdit queue\nbutton in the queue detail view to manage the assignments. - View the users assigned to the queue by expanding the\nUser Assignment\nsection. - Assign new users by clicking the\nAssign users\nbutton and searching for the users you want to assign. - Unassign current users by clicking the\nX\nicon on the right of the user.\nRun Annotation Queues\nPopulate Annotation Queues\nOnce you have created annotation queues, you can assign traces, sessions or observations to them.\nTo add multiple traces, sessions or observations to a queue:\n- Navigate to the respective table view and optionally adjust the filters\n- Select Traces, Sessions or Observations via the checkboxes.\n- Click on the \u201cActions\u201d dropdown menu\n- Click on\nAdd to queue\nto add the selected traces, sessions or observations to the queue. - Select the queue you want to add the traces, sessions or observations to.\nNavigate to Annotation Queue\n- Navigate to\nYour Project\n>Human Annotation\n- Option 1: Click on the queue name to view the associated annotation tasks\n- Option 2: Click on \u201cProcess queue\u201d to start processing the queue\nProcess Annotation Tasks\nYou will see an annotation task for each item in the queue.\n- On the\nAnnotate\nCard add scores on the defined dimensions - Click on\nComplete + next\nto move to the next annotation task or finish the queue\nManage Annotation Queues via API\nYou can enqueue, manage and dequeue annotation tasks via the API. This allows for scaling and automating your annotation workflows.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192 Langfuse

expected outputs and is used to test your application. Before executing your first dataset run, you need to create a dataset.\nWhy use datasets?\n- Datasets prerequisite for Dataset Runs, they serve as the data input of Dataset Runs\n- Create test cases for your application with real production traces\n- Collaboratively create and collect dataset items with your team\n- Have a single source of truth for your test data\nGet Started\nCreating a dataset\nDatasets have a name which is unique within a project.\nlangfuse.create_dataset(\nname=\"<dataset_name>\",\n# optional description\ndescription=\"My first dataset\",\n# optional metadata\nmetadata={\n\"author\": \"Alice\",\n\"date\": \"2022-01-01\",\n\"type\": \"benchmark\"\n}\n)\nSee Python SDK docs for details on how to initialize the Python client.\nCreate new dataset items\nDataset items can be added to a dataset by providing the input and optionally the expected output.\nlangfuse.create_dataset_item(\ndataset_name=\"<dataset_name>\",\n# any python object or value, optional\ninput={\n\"text\": \"hello world\"\n},\n# any python object or value, optional\nexpected_output={\n\"text\": \"hello world\"\n},\n# metadata, optional\nmetadata={\n\"model\": \"llama3\",\n}\n)\nSee Python SDK docs for details on how to initialize the Python client.\nCreate synthetic datasets\nFrequently, you want to create synthetic examples to test your application to bootstrap your dataset. LLMs are great at generating these by prompting for common questions/tasks.\nTo get started have a look at this cookbook for examples on how to generate synthetic datasets:\nCreate items from production data\nA common workflow is to select production traces where the application did not perform as expected. Then you let an expert add the expected output to test new versions of your application on the same data.\nlangfuse.create_dataset_item(\ndataset_name=\"<dataset_name>\",\ninput={ \"text\": \"hello world\" },\nexpected_output={ \"text\": \"hello world\" },\n# link to a trace\nsource_trace_id=\"<trace_id>\",\n# optional: link to a specific span, event, or generation\nsource_observation_id=\"<observation_id>\"\n)\nEdit/archive dataset items\nYou can edit or archive dataset items. Archiving items will remove them from future experiment runs.\nYou can upsert items by providing the id\nof the item you want to update.\nlangfuse.create_dataset_item(\nid=\"<item_id>\",\n# example: update status to \"ARCHIVED\"\nstatus=\"ARCHIVED\"\n)\nDataset runs\nOnce you created a dataset, you can test and evaluate your application based on it.", "links": [{"href":

is measured through user feedback, model-based scoring, human-in-the-loop scored samples or custom scores via SDKs/API (see scores). Quality is assessed over time as well as across prompt versions, LLMs and users.\n- Cost and Latency are accurately measured and broken down by user, session, geography, feature, model and prompt version.\n- Volume based on the ingested traces and tokens used.\nDimensions:\n- Trace name: differentiate between different use cases, features, etc. by adding a\nname\nfield to your traces. - User: track usage and cost by user. Just add a\nuserId\nto your traces (docs). - Tags: filter different use cases, features, etc. by adding tags to your traces.\n- Release and version numbers: track how changes to the LLM application affected your metrics.\nFor an exact definition, please refer to the metrics API docs.\nWas this page helpful?", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga",

"https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/sdk-v3": {"url": "https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/sdk-v3", "title": "Overview of the Python SDK - Langfuse", "text": "Overview\nIf you are self-hosting Langfuse, the Python SDK v3 requires Langfuse platform version >= 3.63.0 for traces to be correctly processed.\nDocumentation for the legacy Python SDK v2 can be found here.\nOur OpenTelemetry-based Python SDK (v3) is the latest generation of the SDK designed for a improved developer experience and enhanced ease of use. Built on the OpenTelemetry Python SDK, it offers a more intuitive API for comprehensive tracing of your LLM application.\nKey benefits:\n- Improved Developer Experience: A more intuitive API means less code to write for tracing your application, simplifying the integration process.\n- Unified Context Sharing: Seamlessly hook into the tracing context of the current span to update it or create child spans. This is particularly beneficial for integrating with other instrumented libraries.\n- Broad Third-Party Integrations: Any library instrumented with OpenTelemetry will work out-of-the-box with the Langfuse SDK. Spans from these libraries are automatically captured and correctly nested within your Langfuse traces.\nQuickstart\nThere are three main ways of instrumenting your application with the new Langfuse SDK. All of them are fully interoperable with each other.\nThe @observe\ndecorator is the simplest way to instrument your application. It is a function decorator that can be applied to any function.\nIt sets the current span in the context for automatic nesting of child spans and automatically ends it when the function returns. It also automatically captures the function name, arguments, and return value.\nfrom langfuse import observe, get_client\n@observe\ndef my_function():\nreturn \"Hello, world!\" # Input/output and timings are automatically captured\nmy_function()\n# Flush events in short-lived applications\nlangfuse = get_client()\nlangfuse.flush()\nLearn more\nOTel and Langfuse\nThe Python SDK v3 is built upon OpenTelemetry (OTel), a standard for observability. Understanding the relation between OTel and Langfuse is not required to use the SDK, but it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the concepts. OTel related concepts are abstracted away and you can use the SDK without being deeply familiar with them.\n- OTel Trace: An OTel-trace represents the entire lifecycle of a request or transaction as it moves through your application and its services. A trace is typically a sequence of operations, like an LLM generating a response followed by a parsing step. The root (first) span created in a sequence defines the OTel trace. OTel traces do not have a start and end time, they are defined by the root span.\n- OTel Span: A span represents a single unit of work or operation within a trace. Spans have a start and end time, a name, and can have attributes (key-value pairs of metadata). Spans can be nested to create a hierarchy, showing parent-child relationships between operations.\n- Langfuse Trace: A Langfuse trace collects observations and holds trace attributes such as\nsession_id\n,user_id\nas well as overall input and outputs. It shares the same ID as the OTel trace and its attributes are set via specific OTel span attributes that are automatically propagated to the Langfuse trace. - Langfuse Observation: In Langfuse terminology, an \u201cobservation\u201d is a Langfuse-specific representation of an OTel span. It can be a generic span (Langfuse-span) or a specialized \u201cgeneration\u201d (Langfuse-generation) or a point in time event (Langfuse-event).\n- Langfuse Span: A Langfuse-span is a generic OTel span in Langfuse, designed for non-LLM operations.\n- Langfuse Generation: A Langfuse-generation is a specialized type of OTel span in Langfuse, designed specifically for Large Language Model (LLM) calls. It includes additional fields like\nmodel\n,model_parameters\n,usage_details\n(tokens), andcost_details\n. - Langfuse Event: A Langfuse-event tracks a point in time action.\n- Context Propagation: OpenTelemetry automatically handles the propagation of the current trace and span context. This means when you call another function (whether it\u2019s also traced by Langfuse, an OTel-instrumented library, or a manually created span), the new span will automatically become a child of the currently active span, forming a correct trace hierarchy.\nThe Langfuse SDK provides wrappers around OTel spans (LangfuseSpan\n, LangfuseGeneration\n) that offer convenient methods for interacting with Langfuse-specific features like scoring and media handling, while still being native OTel spans under the hood. You can also use these wrapper objects to add Langfuse trace attributes.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192

SDK - Overview\nThe modular Langfuse TypeScript SDK (v4) is built on OpenTelemetry for robust observability, better context management, and easy integration with third-party libraries.\nThis documentation is for the TypeScript SDK v4. If you are looking for the documentation for the TypeScript SDK v3, please click here.\nIf you are self-hosting Langfuse, the TypeScript SDK v4 requires Langfuse platform version \u2265 3.95.0 for all features to work correctly.\nQuickstart\nGet your first trace into Langfuse in just a few minutes.\nInstall packages\nInstall the relevant packages to get started with tracing:\nnpm install @langfuse/tracing @langfuse/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-node\nLearn more about the packages here.\nSet up environment variables\nAdd your Langfuse credentials to your environment variables. Make sure that you have a .env\nfile in your project root and a package like dotenv\nto load the variables.\nLANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY = \"sk-lf-...\"\nLANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY = \"pk-lf-...\"\nLANGFUSE_BASE_URL = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa EU region\n# LANGFUSE_BASE_URL = \"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US region\nSet up OpenTelemetry\nCreate a file named instrumentation.ts\nto initialize the OpenTelemetry SDK. The LangfuseSpanProcessor\nis the key component that sends traces to Langfuse.\nimport { NodeSDK } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\";\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \"@langfuse/otel\";\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\nspanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()],\n});\nsdk.start();\nImport the instrumentation.ts\nfile at the very top of your application\u2019s entry point (e.g., index.ts\n).\nimport \"./instrumentation\"; // Must be the first import\nLearn more about setting up OpenTelemetry here.\nInstrument your application\nUse one of the native Langfuse framework integrations to automatically trace your application.\nAlternatively, manually instrument your application, e.g. by using the startActiveObservation\n. This function takes a callback and automatically manages the observation\u2019s lifecycle and the OpenTelemetry context. Any observation created inside the callback will automatically be nested under the active observation, and the observation will be ended when the callback finishes.\nThis is just an example, check out the instrumentation page for more details.\nimport \"./instrumentation\";\nimport { startActiveObservation } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\nasync function main() {\nawait startActiveObservation(\"my-first-trace\", async (span) => {\nspan.update({\ninput: \"Hello, Langfuse!\",\noutput: \"This is my first trace!\",\n});\n});\n}\nmain();\nRun your application\nExecute your application. You should see your trace appear in the Langfuse UI.\nnpx tsx index.ts\nPackages\nThe Langfuse SDK is designed to be modular. Here\u2019s an overview of the available packages:\nOpenTelemetry foundation\nBuilding on OpenTelemetry is a core design choice for this SDK. It offers several key advantages:\n- Standardization: It aligns with the industry standard for observability, making it easier to integrate with existing monitoring and APM tools.\n- Robust Context Management: OpenTelemetry provides reliable context propagation, ensuring that traces are correctly linked even in complex, asynchronous applications.\n- Ecosystem & Interoperability: You can leverage a vast ecosystem of third-party instrumentations. If a library you use supports OpenTelemetry, its traces can be sent to Langfuse automatically.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor":

Langfuse", "text": "Observability for OpenAI SDK (Python)\nLooking for the JS/TS version? Check it out here.\nIf you use the OpenAI Python SDK, you can use the Langfuse drop-in replacement to get full logging by changing only the import. This works with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.\n- import openai\n+ from langfuse.openai import openai\nAlternative imports:\n+ from langfuse.openai import OpenAI, AsyncOpenAI, AzureOpenAI, AsyncAzureOpenAI\nLangfuse automatically tracks:\n- All prompts/completions with support for streaming, async and functions\n- Latencies\n- API Errors\n- Model usage (tokens) and cost (USD) (learn more)\nHow it works\nInstall Langfuse SDK\nThe integration is compatible with OpenAI SDK versions >=0.27.8\n. It supports async functions and streaming for OpenAI SDK versions >=1.0.0\n.\npip install langfuse openai\nSwitch to Langfuse Wrapped OpenAI SDK\nAdd Langfuse credentials to your environment variables\nLANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY = \"sk-lf-...\"\nLANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY = \"pk-lf-...\"\nLANGFUSE_HOST = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa EU region\n# LANGFUSE_HOST = \"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US region\nChange import\n- import openai\n+ from langfuse.openai import openai\nAlternative imports:\n+ from langfuse.openai import OpenAI, AsyncOpenAI, AzureOpenAI, AsyncAzureOpenAI\nOptional, checks the SDK connection with the server. Not recommended for production usage.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nget_client().auth_check()\nUse OpenAI SDK as usual\nNo changes required.\nCheck out the notebook for end-to-end examples of the integration:\nTroubleshooting\nQueuing and batching of events\nThe Langfuse SDKs queue and batches events in the background to reduce the number of network requests and improve overall performance. In a long-running application, this works without any additional configuration.\nIf you are running a short-lived application, you need to flush Langfuse to ensure that all events are flushed before the application exits.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\n# Flush via global client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nlangfuse.flush()\nLearn more about queuing and batching of events here.\nAssistants API\nTracing of the assistants api is not supported by this integration as OpenAI Assistants have server-side state that cannot easily be captured without additional api requests. We added some more information on how to best track usage of the assistants api in this FAQ.\nDebug mode\nIf you are having issues with the integration, you can enable debug mode to get more information about the requests and responses.\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\n# Enable debug via global client\nlangfuse = Langfuse(debug=True)\nAlternatively, you can set the environment variable:\nexport LANGFUSE_DEBUG=true\nSampling\nSampling can be used to control the volume of traces collected by the Langfuse server.\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\n# Set sampling via global client (default is 1.0)\nlangfuse = Langfuse(sample_rate=0.1)\nAlternatively, you can set the environment variable:\nexport LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1\nDisable tracing\nYou may disable sending traces to Langfuse by setting the appropriate flag.\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\n# Disable via global client\nlangfuse = Langfuse(tracing_enabled=False)\nAlternatively, you can set the environment variable:\nexport LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENABLED=false\nAdvanced usage\nCustom trace properties\nYou can add the following properties to the openai method:\nSetting trace attributes (session_id\n, user_id\n, tags\n):\nYou have two options:\nOption 1: Via metadata (simplest approach):\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nresult = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a very accurate calculator.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"1 + 1 = \"}\n],\nname=\"test-chat\",\nmetadata={\n\"langfuse_session_id\": \"session_123\",\n\"langfuse_user_id\": \"user_456\",\n\"langfuse_tags\": [\"calculator\"],\n\"someMetadataKey\": \"someValue\" # Regular metadata still works\n}\n)\nOption 2: Via enclosing span (for more control):\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"calculator-request\") as span:\nspan.update_trace(\nsession_id=\"session_123\",\nuser_id=\"user_456\",\ntags=[\"calculator\"]\n)\nresult = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a very accurate calculator.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"1 + 1 = \"}\n],\nname=\"test-chat\",\nmetadata={\"someMetadataKey\": \"someValue\"},\n)\nUse Traces\nLangfuse Tracing groups multiple observations (can be any LLM or non-LLM call) into a single trace. This integration by default creates a single trace for each openai call.\n- Add non-OpenAI related observations to the trace.\n- Group multiple OpenAI calls into a single trace while customizing the trace.\n- Have more control over the trace structure.\n- Use all Langfuse Tracing features.\nNew to Langfuse Tracing? Checkout this introduction to the basic concepts.\nYou can use any of the following options:\n- Python\n@observe()\ndecorator - works with both v2 and v3 - Use explicit span management - differs between v3 and v2\nOption 1: Python Decorator\nfrom langfuse import observe\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\n@observe()\ndef capital_poem_generator(country):\ncapital = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"What is the capital of the country?\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": country}],\nname=\"get-capital\",\n).choices[0].message.content\npoem = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a poet. Create a poem about this city.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": capital}],\nname=\"generate-poem\",\n).choices[0].message.content\nreturn poem\ncapital_poem_generator(\"Bulgaria\")\nOption 2: Context Managers\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"capital-poem-generator\") as span:\n# Set trace attributes\nspan.update_trace(\nuser_id=\"user_123\",\nsession_id=\"session_456\",\ntags=[\"poetry\", \"capital\"]\n)\ncapital = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"What is the capital of the country?\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Bulgaria\"}],\nname=\"get-capital\",\n).choices[0].message.content\npoem = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a poet. Create a poem about this city.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": capital}],\nname=\"generate-poem\",\n).choices[0].message.content\nOpenAI token usage on streamed responses\nOpenAI returns the token usage on streamed responses only when in stream_options\nthe include_usage\nparameter is set to True\n. If you would like to benefit from OpenAI\u2019s directly provided token usage, you can set {\"include_usage\": True} in the\nstream_options` argument.\nWhen using streaming responses with include_usage=True\n, OpenAI returns token\nusage information in a final chunk that has an empty choices\nlist. Make sure\nyour application properly handles these empty choices\nchunks to ensure\naccurate token usage tracking by not trying to access some index in the\nchoices\nlist without checking if it is non-empty.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nclient = openai.OpenAI()\nstream = client.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How are you?\"}],\nstream=True,\nstream_options={\"include_usage\": True},\n)\nresult = \"\"\nfor chunk in stream:\n# Check if chunk choices are not empty. OpenAI returns token usage in a final chunk with an empty choices list.\nif chunk.choices:\nresult += chunk.choices[0].delta.content or \"\"\n# Flush via global client\nget_client().flush()\nOpenAI Beta APIs\nSince OpenAI beta APIs are changing frequently across versions, we fully support only the stable APIs in the OpenAI SDK. If you are using a beta API, you can still use the Langfuse SDK by wrapping the OpenAI SDK manually with the @observe()\ndecorator.\nStructured Output\nFor structured output parsing, please use the response_format\nargument to openai.chat.completions.create()\ninstead of the Beta API. This will allow you to set Langfuse attributes and metadata.\nIf you rely on parsing Pydantic defintions for your response_format\n, you may leverage the type_to_response_format_param\nutility function from the OpenAI Python SDK to convert the Pydantic definition to a response_format\ndictionary. This is the same function the OpenAI Beta API uses to convert Pydantic definitions to response_format\ndictionaries.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nfrom openai.lib._parsing._completions import type_to_response_format_param\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass CalendarEvent(BaseModel):\nname: str\ndate: str\nparticipants: list[str]\ncompletion = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o-2024-08-06\",\nmessages=[\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Extract the event information.\"},\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": \"Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday.\",\n},\n],\nresponse_format=type_to_response_format_param(CalendarEvent),\n)\nprint(completion)\n# Flush via global client\nget_client().flush()\nAssistants API\nTracing of the assistants api is not supported by this integration as OpenAI Assistants have server-side state that cannot easily be captured without additional api requests. Check out this notebook for an end-to-end example on how to best track usage of the assistants api in Langfuse.\nTracking of OpenAI API Errors\nLangfuse automatically tracks and monitors OpenAI API errors if you use the native integration. They are captured via the level\nand statusMessage\nfields (see docs).\nLearn more about how to get started here.\n- import openai\n+ from langfuse.openai import openai\n# Cause an error by attempting

LangChain & LangGraph (Python & JS/TS) - Langfuse", "text": "Observability & Tracing for LangChain & LangGraph (Python & JS/TS)\nLangfuse Tracing integrates with Langchain using Langchain Callbacks (Python, JS). The Langfuse SDK automatically captures detailed traces of your Langchain executions, creating properly nested observations for chains, LLMs, tools, and retrievers. This allows you to monitor, analyze and debug your LangChain applications with full observability.\nThis documentation has been updated to show examples for the new Python SDK v3. If you are looking for documentation for the Python SDK version 2, see here.\nAdd Langfuse to your Langchain Application\nYou can configure the integration via (1) constructor arguments or (2) environment variables. Get your Langfuse credentials from the Langfuse dashboard.\nSet environment variables:\nexport LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=\"your-public-key\"\nexport LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=\"your-secret-key\"\nexport LANGFUSE_HOST=\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\" # Optional: defaults to https://cloud.langfuse.com\npip install langfuse\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n# Initialize the Langfuse handler\nlangfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()\n# Create your LangChain components\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o\")\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\nchain = prompt | llm\n# Run your chain with Langfuse tracing\nresponse = chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"}, config={\"callbacks\": [langfuse_handler]})\nprint(response.content)\nDone. Now you can explore detailed traces and metrics in the Langfuse dashboard.\nEnd-to-end Examples\nSupported LangChain interfaces\nWe are interested in your feedback! Raise an issue on GitHub to request support for additional interfaces.\nSupported LangChain features\n- \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f LangGraph: Works with Langfuse Integration. Requires Python 3.11+ (GH issue). See notebook for example integration.\n- \ud83c\udfd3 LangServe: See notebook for example integration.\nAdditional Configuration\nConfiguration Options\nThe CallbackHandler\ndoes not accept any constructor arguments for trace attributes or global settings.\n- Global settings (like\nsample_rate\n,tracing_enabled\n) must be set when initializing the Langfuse client viaLangfuse()\nconstructor or environment variables - Trace attributes (like\nuser_id\n,session_id\n,tags\n) can be set either:- Via metadata fields in chain invocation (\nlangfuse_user_id\n,langfuse_session_id\n,langfuse_tags\n) - Via an enclosing span using\nspan.update_trace()\nas shown in the examples above\n- Via metadata fields in chain invocation (\nDynamic Trace Attributes\nYou can set trace attributes dynamically for each LangChain execution. The approach differs between SDK versions:\nWith Python SDK, you have two options to set trace attributes dynamically:\nOption 1: Via metadata fields in chain invocation (simplest approach):\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nlangfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o\")\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\nchain = prompt | llm\n# Set trace attributes dynamically via metadata\nresponse = chain.invoke(\n{\"topic\": \"cats\"},\nconfig={\n\"callbacks\": [langfuse_handler],\n\"metadata\": {\n\"langfuse_user_id\": \"random-user\",\n\"langfuse_session_id\": \"random-session\",\n\"langfuse_tags\": [\"random-tag-1\", \"random-tag-2\"]\n}\n}\n)\nOption 2: Via enclosing span (for more control):\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nlangfuse = get_client()\nlangfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o\")\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\nchain = prompt | llm\n# Set trace attributes dynamically via enclosing span\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"dynamic-langchain-trace\") as span:\nspan.update_trace(\nuser_id=\"random-user\",\nsession_id=\"random-session\",\ntags=[\"random-tag-1\", \"random-tag-2\"],\ninput={\"animal\": \"dog\"}\n)\nresponse = chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"}, config={\"callbacks\": [langfuse_handler]})\nspan.update_trace(output={\"response\": response.content})\nPredefined Trace ID + Add Evaluation or User Feedback Score\nPredefined Trace ID\nTo score a Langchain execution, you can capture the trace ID for the score by either wrapping the execution in a span that sets a predefined trace ID, or retrieve the last trace ID a callback handler has created via langfuse_handler.last_trace_id\n.\nfrom langfuse import get_client, Langfuse\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Generate deterministic trace ID from external system\nexternal_request_id = \"req_12345\"\npredefined_trace_id = Langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_request_id)\nlangfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()\n# Use the predefined trace ID with trace_context\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(\nname=\"langchain-request\",\ntrace_context={\"trace_id\": predefined_trace_id}\n) as span:\nspan.update_trace(\nuser_id=\"user_123\",\ninput={\"person\": \"Ada Lovelace\"}\n)\n# LangChain execution will be part of this trace\nresponse = chain.invoke(\n{\"person\": \"Ada Lovelace\"},\nconfig={\"callbacks\": [langfuse_handler]}\n)\nspan.update_trace(output={\"response\": response})\nprint(f\"Trace ID: {predefined_trace_id}\") # Use this for scoring later\nprint(f\"Trace ID: {langfuse_handler.last_trace_id}\") # Care needed in concurrent environments where handler is reused\nAdd Score to Trace\nThere are multiple ways to score a trace in Python SDK. See Scoring documentation for more details.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Option 1: Use the yielded span object from the context manager\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(\nname=\"langchain-request\",\ntrace_context={\"trace_id\": predefined_trace_id}\n) as span:\n# ... LangChain execution ...\n# Score using the span object\nspan.score_trace(\nname=\"user-feedback\",\nvalue=1,\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\",\ncomment=\"This was correct, thank you\"\n)\n# Option 2: Use langfuse.score_current_trace() if still in context\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"langchain-request\") as span:\n# ... LangChain execution ...\n# Score using current context\nlangfuse.score_current_trace(\nname=\"user-feedback\",\nvalue=1,\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\"\n)\n# Option 3: Use create_score() with trace ID (when outside context)\nlangfuse.create_score(\ntrace_id=predefined_trace_id,\nname=\"user-feedback\",\nvalue=1,\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\",\ncomment=\"This was correct, thank you\"\n)\nInteroperability with Langfuse SDKs\nThe Langchain integration works seamlessly with the Langfuse SDK to create comprehensive traces that combine Langchain operations with other application logic.\nCommon use cases:\n- Add non-Langchain related observations to the trace\n- Group multiple Langchain runs into a single trace\n- Set trace-level attributes (user_id, session_id, etc.)\n- Add custom spans for business logic around LLM calls\nLearn more about the structure of a trace here.\nUsing the @observe()\ndecorator:\nfrom langfuse import observe, get_client\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n@observe() # Automatically log function as a trace to Langfuse\ndef process_user_query(user_input: str):\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Update trace attributes\nlangfuse.update_current_trace(\nname=\"user-query-processing\",\nsession_id=\"session-1234\",\nuser_id=\"user-5678\",\ninput={\"query\": user_input}\n)\n# Initialize the Langfuse handler - automatically inherits the current trace context\nlangfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()\n# Your Langchain code - will be nested under the @observe trace\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o\")\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Respond to: {input}\")\nchain = prompt | llm\nresult = chain.invoke({\"input\": user_input}, config={\"callbacks\": [langfuse_handler]})\n# Update trace with final output\nlangfuse.update_current_trace(output={\"response\": result.content})\nreturn result.content\n# Usage\nanswer = process_user_query(\"What is the capital of France?\")\nUsing context managers:\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Create a trace via Langfuse spans and use Langchain within it\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"multi-step-process\") as root_span:\n# Update trace attributes\nroot_span.update_trace(\nsession_id=\"session-1234\",\nuser_id=\"user-5678\",\ninput={\"user_query\": \"Explain quantum computing\"}\n)\n# Initialize the Langfuse handler\nlangfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()\n# Step 1: Initial processing (custom logic)\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"input-preprocessing\") as prep_span:\nprocessed_input = \"Simplified: Explain quantum computing\"\nprep_span.update(output={\"processed_query\": processed_input})\n# Step 2: LangChain processing\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o\")\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Answer this question: {input}\")\nchain = prompt | llm\nresult = chain.invoke(\n{\"input\": processed_input},\nconfig={\"callbacks\": [langfuse_handler]}\n)\n# Step 3: Post-processing (custom logic)\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"output-postprocessing\") as post_span:\nfinal_result = f\"Response: {result.content}\"\npost_span.update(output={\"final_response\": final_result})\n# Update trace output\nroot_span.update_trace(output={\"final_answer\": final_result})\nIf you pass these callback handlers to your Langchain code, the events will be nested under the respective trace or span in the Langfuse.\nSee the Langchain + decorator observability cookbook for an example of this in action (Python).\nQueuing and flushing\nThe Langfuse SDKs queue and batch events in the background to reduce the number of network requests and improve overall performance. In a long-running application, this works without any additional configuration.\nIf you are running a short-lived application, you need to shutdown Langfuse to ensure that all events are flushed before the application exits.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\n# Shutdown the underlying singleton instance\nget_client().shutdown()\nIf you want to flush events synchronously at a certain point, you can use the flush\nmethod. This will wait for all events that are still in the background queue to be sent to the Langfuse API. This is usually discouraged in production environments.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\n# Flush the underlying singleton instance\nget_client().flush()\nServerless environments (JS/TS)\nSince Langchain version > 0.3.0, the callbacks on which Langfuse relies have been backgrounded. This means that execution will not wait for the callback to either return before continuing. Prior to 0.3.0, this behavior was the opposite. If you are running code in serverless environments such as Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda or Cloudflare Workers you should set your callbacks to be blocking to allow them time to finish or timeout. This can be done either by\n- setting the\nLANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND\nenvironment variable to \u201cfalse\u201d - importing the global\nawaitAllCallbacks\nmethod to ensure all callbacks finish if necessary\nRead more about awaiting callbacks here in the Langchain docs.\nAzure OpenAI model names\nPlease add the model\nkeyword argument to the AzureOpenAI\nor AzureChatOpenAI\nclass to have the model name parsed correctly in Langfuse.\nfrom langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI\nllm = AzureChatOpenAI(\nazure_deployment=\"my-gpt-4o-deployment\",\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\n)\nUpgrade Paths for Langchain Integration\nThis doc is a collection of upgrade paths for different versions of the integration. If you want to add the integration to your project, you should start with the latest version and follow the integration guide above.\nLangfuse and Langchain are under active development. Thus, we are constantly improving the integration. This means that we sometimes need to make breaking changes to our APIs or need to react to breaking changes in Langchain. We try to keep these to a minimum and to provide clear upgrade paths when we do make them.\nPython\nJS/TS\nPython\nFrom v2.x.x to v3.x.x\nPython SDK v3 introduces a completely revised Langfuse core with a new observability API. While the LangChain integration still relies on a CallbackHandler\n, nearly all ergonomics have changed. The table below highlights the most important breaking changes:\nMinimal migration example:\n# Install latest SDK (>=3.0.0)\npip install --upgrade langfuse\n# v2 Code (for reference)\n# from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler\n# handler = CallbackHandler()\n# chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"}, config={\"callbacks\": [handler]})\n# v3 Code\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse, get_client\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n# 1. Create/Configure Langfuse client (once at startup)\nLangfuse(\npublic_key=\"your-public-key\",\nsecret_key=\"your-secret-key\",\n)\n# 2.

LlamaIndex (GitHub) is an advanced \u201cdata framework\u201d tailored for augmenting LLMs with private data. It streamlines the integration of diverse data sources and formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.) through versatile data connectors and structures data into indices and graphs for LLM compatibility. The platform offers a sophisticated retrieval/query interface for enriching LLM inputs with context-specific outputs.\nWhat is Langfuse? Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform. It offers tracing and monitoring capabilities for AI applications. Langfuse helps developers debug, analyze, and optimize their AI systems by providing detailed insights and integrating with a wide array of tools and frameworks through native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and dedicated SDKs.\nGetting Started\nLet\u2019s walk through a practical example of using LlamaIndex and integrating it with Langfuse for comprehensive tracing.\nStep 1: Install Dependencies\n%pip install langfuse openinference-instrumentation-llama-index llama-index-llms-openai llama-index -U\nStep 2: Configure Langfuse SDK\nNext, set up your Langfuse API keys. You can get these keys by signing up for a free Langfuse Cloud account or by self-hosting Langfuse. These environment variables are essential for the Langfuse client to authenticate and send data to your Langfuse project.\nimport os\n# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\"] = \"pk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\"] = \"sk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_HOST\"] = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa EU region\n# os.environ[\"LANGFUSE_HOST\"] = \"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US region\n# Your OpenAI key\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-proj-...\"\nWith the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. get_client()\ninitializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Verify connection\nif langfuse.auth_check():\nprint(\"Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!\")\nelse:\nprint(\"Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.\")\nStep 3: Initialize LlamaIndex Instrumentation\nNow, we initialize the OpenInference LlamaIndex instrumentation. This third-party instrumentation automatically captures LlamaIndex operations and exports OpenTelemetry (OTel) spans to Langfuse.\nfrom openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor\n# Initialize LlamaIndex instrumentation\nLlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()\nStep 4: Basic LlamaIndex Application\nLet\u2019s create a straightforward LlamaIndex application. In this example, we\u2019ll create a simple query engine that can answer questions. This will serve as the foundation for demonstrating Langfuse tracing.\nfrom llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\")\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"llama-index-trace\"):\nresponse = llm.complete(\"Hello, world!\")\nprint(response)\nlangfuse.flush()\nStep 5: View Traces in Langfuse\nAfter executing the application, navigate to your Langfuse Trace Table. You will find detailed traces of the application\u2019s execution, providing insights into the LLM calls, retrieval operations, inputs, outputs, and performance metrics. The trace will show the complete flow from query processing through document retrieval to response generation.\nInteroperability with the Python SDK\nYou can use this integration together with the Langfuse Python SDK to add additional attributes to the trace.\nThe @observe()\ndecorator provides a convenient way to automatically wrap your instrumented code and add additional attributes to the trace.\nfrom langfuse import observe, get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n@observe()\ndef my_instrumented_function(input):\noutput = my_llm_call(input)\nlangfuse.update_current_trace(\ninput=input,\noutput=output,\nuser_id=\"user_123\",\nsession_id=\"session_abc\",\ntags=[\"agent\", \"my-trace\"],\nmetadata={\"email\": \"[email protected]\"},\nversion=\"1.0.0\"\n)\nreturn output\nLearn more about using the Decorator in the Python SDK docs.\nNext Steps\nOnce you have instrumented your code, you can manage, evaluate and debug your application:", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192 Langfuse TypeScript SDK v4 is here \u2192"}, {"href":

"Integration: \ud83d\ude85 LiteLLM Proxy\nLiteLLM (GitHub): Use any LLM as a drop in replacement for GPT. Use Azure, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, Ollama, VLLM, Sagemaker, HuggingFace, Replicate (100+ LLMs).\nThis integration is for the LiteLLM Proxy. If you are looking for the LiteLLM SDK integration, see the LiteLLM SDK Integration page.\nThere are two ways to integrate LiteLLM with Langfuse:\n- LiteLLM Proxy with OpenAI SDK Wrapper, the proxy standardizes 100+ models on the OpenAI API schema and the Langfuse OpenAI SDK wrapper instruments the LLM calls.\n- LiteLLM Proxy which can send logs to Langfuse if enabled in the UI.\n1. LiteLLM Proxy + Langfuse OpenAI SDK Wrapper\nThis is the preferred way to integrate LiteLLM with Langfuse. The Langfuse OpenAI SDK wrapper automatically captures token counts, latencies, streaming response times (time to first token), API errors, and more.\nHow this works:\n- The LiteLLM Proxy standardizes 100+ models on the OpenAI API schema\n- and the Langfuse OpenAI SDK wrapper (Python, JS/TS) instruments the LLM calls.\nTo see a full end-to-end example, check out the LiteLLM cookbook.\n2. Send Logs from LiteLLM Proxy to Langfuse\nBy setting the callback to Langfuse in the LiteLLM UI you can instantly log your responses across all providers. For more information on how to setup the Proxy UI, see the LiteLLM docs.\nYou can add additional Langfuse attributes to the requests in order to group requests into traces, add userIds, tags, sessionIds, and more. These attributes are shared across LiteLLM Proxy and SDK, please refer to both documentation pages to learn about all potential options:\nLearn more about LiteLLM\nWhat is LiteLLM?\nLiteLLM is an open source proxy server to manage auth, loadbalancing, and spend tracking across more than 100 LLMs. LiteLLM has grown to be a popular utility for developers working with LLMs and is universally thought to be a useful abstraction.\nIs LiteLLM an Open Source project?\nYes, LiteLLM is open source. The majority of its code is permissively MIT-licensed. You can find the open source LiteLLM repository on GitHub.\nCan I use LiteLLM with Ollama and local models?\nYes, you can use LiteLLM with Ollama and other local models. LiteLLM supports all models from Ollama, and it provides a Docker image for an OpenAI API-compatible server for local LLMs like llama2, mistral, and codellama.\nHow does LiteLLM simplify API calls across multiple LLM providers?\nLiteLLM provides a unified interface for calling models such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Ollama and others. This means you can call any supported model using a consistent method, such as completion(model, messages)\n, and expect a uniform response format. The library does away with the need for if/else statements or provider-specific code, making it easier to manage and debug LLM interactions in your application.", "links": [{"href":

Langfuse", "text": "Vercel AI SDK - Observability & Analytics\nTelemetry is an experimental feature of the AI SDK and might change in the future.\nThe Vercel AI SDK offers native instrumentation with OpenTelemetry. You can enable the Vercel AI SDK telemetry by passing { experimental_telemetry: { isEnabled: true }}\nto your AI SDK function calls.\nThe LangfuseSpanProcessor is automatically detecting multimodal data in your traces and is handling it automatically.\nHere is a full example on how to set up tracing with the\n- AI SDK v5\n- Next.js\n- Deployed on Vercel\nCreate a new file instrumentation.ts\nin your project root with the following content:\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor, ShouldExportSpan } from \"@langfuse/otel\";\nimport { NodeTracerProvider } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node\";\n// Optional: filter our NextJS infra spans\nconst shouldExportSpan: ShouldExportSpan = (span) => {\nreturn span.otelSpan.instrumentationScope.name !== \"next.js\";\n};\nexport const langfuseSpanProcessor = new LangfuseSpanProcessor({\nshouldExportSpan,\n});\nconst tracerProvider = new NodeTracerProvider({\nspanProcessors: [langfuseSpanProcessor],\n});\ntracerProvider.register();\nIf you are using Next.js, please use a manual OpenTelemetry setup via the\nNodeTracerProvider\nrather than via registerOTel\nfrom @vercel/otel\n. This\nis because the @vercel/otel\npackage does not yet support the OpenTelemetry\nJS SDK v2 on which the\n@langfuse/tracing\nand @langfuse/otel\npackages are based.\nimport { streamText } from \"ai\";\nimport { after } from \"next/server\";\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\nimport {\nobserve,\nupdateActiveObservation,\nupdateActiveTrace,\n} from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\nimport { trace } from \"@opentelemetry/api\";\nimport { langfuseSpanProcessor } from \"@/src/instrumentation\";\nconst handler = async (req: Request) => {\nconst {\nmessages,\nchatId,\nuserId,\n}: { messages: UIMessage[]; chatId: string; userId: string } =\nawait req.json();\n// Set session id and user id on active trace\nconst inputText = messages[messages.length - 1].parts.find(\n(part) => part.type === \"text\"\n)?.text;\nupdateActiveObservation({\ninput: inputText,\n});\nupdateActiveTrace({\nname: \"my-ai-sdk-trace\",\nsessionId: chatId,\nuserId,\ninput: inputText,\n});\nconst result = streamText({\n// ... other streamText options ...\nexperimental_telemetry: {\nisEnabled: true,\n},\nonFinish: async (result) => {\nupdateActiveObservation({\noutput: result.content,\n});\nupdateActiveTrace({\noutput: result.content,\n});\n// End span manually after stream has finished\ntrace.getActiveSpan().end();\n},\nonError: async (error) => {\nupdateActiveObservation({\noutput: error,\nlevel: \"ERROR\"\n});\nupdateActiveTrace({\noutput: error,\n});\n// End span manually after stream has finished\ntrace.getActiveSpan()?.end();\n},\n});\n// Important in serverless environments: schedule flush after request is finished\nafter(async () => await langfuseSpanProcessor.forceFlush());\nreturn result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n};\nexport const POST = observe(handler, {\nname: \"handle-chat-message\",\nendOnExit: false, // end observation _after_ stream has finished\n});\nLearn more about the AI SDK Telemetry in the Vercel AI SDK documentation on Telemetry.\nUsing Prompt Management\nIf you want to use Langfuse Prompt Management to link traces to prompt versions so you can understand how your prompts are performing and run experiments, you can do the following:\n// ... existing imports ...\nimport { LangfuseClient } from \"@langfuse/client\"; // Add this import\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient();\nconst handler = async (req: Request) => {\n// ... existing code ...\n// Add these lines to fetch and link a

"Instructor - Observability & Tracing\nWhat is Instructor? Instructor (GitHub) is a popular library to get structured LLM outputs.Instructor makes it easy to reliably get structured data like JSON from Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-Vision, including open source models like Mistral/Mixtral from Together, Anyscale, Ollama, and llama-cpp-python. By leveraging various modes like Function Calling, Tool Calling and even constrained sampling modes like JSON mode, JSON Schema; Instructor stands out for its simplicity, transparency, and user-centric design. Under the hood, Instructor leverages Pydantic to do the heavy lifting, and provides a simple, easy-to-use API on top of it by helping you manage validation context, retries with Tenacity, and streaming Lists and Partial responses.\nWhat is Langfuse? Langfuse is an open source LLM engineering platform that helps teams trace API calls, monitor performance, and debug issues in their AI applications.\nThis is a cookbook with examples of the Langfuse Integration for Python.\nSetup\n%pip install langfuse openai pydantic instructor --upgrade\nInitialize the Langfuse client with your API keys from the project settings in the Langfuse UI and add them to your environment.\nimport os\n# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\"] = \"pk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\"] = \"sk-lf-...\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_HOST\"] = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa EU region\n# os.environ[\"LANGFUSE_HOST\"] = \"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US region\n# Your openai key\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-proj-...\"\nGet started\nIt is easy to use instructor with Langfuse.

API\nLangfuse is open and meant to be extended via custom workflows and integrations. All Langfuse data and features are available via the API.\n/api/public\nReferences:\n- API Reference: https://api.reference.langfuse.com\n- OpenAPI spec: https://cloud.langfuse.com/generated/api/openapi.yml\n- Postman collection: https://cloud.langfuse.com/generated/postman/collection.json\nThere are 3 different groups of APIs:\n- This page -> Project-level APIs: CRUD traces/evals/prompts/configuration within a project\n- Organization-level APIs: provision projects, users (SCIM), and permissions\n- Management API: administer organizations on self-hosted installations\nAuthentication\nAuthenticate with the API using Basic Auth. The API keys are available in the Langfuse project settings.\n- Username: Langfuse Public Key\n- Password: Langfuse Secret Key\nExample:\ncurl -u public-key:secret-key https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/projects\nAccess via SDKs\nBoth the Langfuse Python SDK and the JS/TS SDK provide a strongly-typed wrapper around our public REST API for your convenience. The API methods are accessible via the api\nproperty on the Langfuse client instance in both SDKs.\nYou can use your editor\u2019s Intellisense to explore the API methods and their parameters.\nWhen fetching prompts, please use the get_prompt\n(Python) / getPrompt\n(JS/TS) methods on the Langfuse client to benefit from client-side caching, automatic retries, and fallbacks.\nWhen using the Python SDK:\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n...\n# fetch a trace\nlangfuse.api.trace.get(trace_id)\n# async client via asyncio\nawait langfuse.async_api.trace(trace_id)\n# explore more endpoints via Intellisense\nlangfuse.api.*\nawait langfuse.async_api.*\nIngest Traces via the API\nIt is recommended to use the OpenTelemetry Endpoint to ingest traces. Please refer to the OpenTelemetry docs for more information.\nAlternatives\nYou can also export data via:\n- UI - Manual batch-exports from the Langfuse UI\n- Blob Storage - Scheduled automated

addresses key challenges when deploying LLM-based applications within an enterprise. As an open source project, Langfuse is the ideal platform to address data security and privacy concerns by self-hosting. This document outlines common queries related to using Langfuse in an enterprise setting.\nLangfuse is licensed as an open-core project. It\u2019s core product (tracing, observability, evals, prompt management and API/SDK endpoints) is MIT-licensed and freely available (also without limitation for commercial use).\nYour platform for enterprise-ready LLM applications\nUpgrade to Langfuse Enterprise Edition to address high security requirements and needs of platform teams to support billions of traces per month. With an Enterprise Agreement, you get access to additional support, features to address your specific needs and compliance requirements.\nPlease refer to our feature overview and the Enterprise Edition FAQ here.\nLangfuse is trusted by the best teams building LLM applications and AI agents and supported by the largest open source community:\nSelect Resources\n- Why Langfuse?\n- Langfuse has twice been included in the Thoughtworks Tech Radar\n- Feature Comparison - Open Source and Enterprise Edition (Self-hosted)\n- Security and Compliance - includes information on GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 and ISO27001 compliance\n- Enterprise Security FAQ\n- Langfuse can be procured through the AWS Marketplace or per invoice.\nTalk to us\nReady to get started with Langfuse Enterprise?

If you have questions that are not answered, please reach out to us: [email protected]\nWhat deployment options are available for Langfuse?\n- Managed Cloud (cloud.langfuse.com), see Pricing and Security page for details.\n- Self-hosted on your own infrastructure. Contact us if you are interested in additional support.\nWhat is the difference between Langfuse Cloud and the open-source version?\nThe Langfuse team provides Langfuse Cloud as a managed solution to simplify the initial setup of Langfuse and to minimize the operational overhead of maintaining high availability in production. You can chose to self-host Langfuse on your own infrastructure.\nSome features are not available in the open-source version. Please refer to the overview here.\nHow does Authentication and RBAC work in Langfuse?\nLangfuse offers a list of prebuilt roles which apply on an organizational and project level to restrict access (RBAC documentation).\nIf needed, environments (production, staging, development) can be separated into different projects in Langfuse to restrict access to production/sensitive data while making it easier to share development environments with the team and other stakeholders.\nSSO with Langfuse is simple. Currently Google, GitHub, Azure AD, Okta, Auth0, and AWS Cognito are supported. We can easily add additional providers based on your requirements. As an enterprise customer, you can also enforce SSO for your organization.\nWhat is the easiest way to try Langfuse?\nThe Hobby Plan on Langfuse Cloud includes enough resources to try Langfuse for free while in a non-production environment, no credit card required.\nAlternatively, you can quickly spin up Langfuse on your own machine using docker compose up\n(docs).\nIf you require security and compliance features to run a POC, please reach out to us at [email protected].\nCommon Enterprise LLM Platform Architecture\nLangfuse aims to address the challenges of debugging, monitoring, and continuously improving LLM-based applications. It focuses on observability, evaluation, and prompt management.\nLangfuse is often deployed alongside a central LLM Gateway that provides schema translation, rate limiting, and PII redaction. The LLM Gateway can be an internal service or an open-source project like LiteLLM. If you use LiteLLM, you can leverage the native integration (docs).", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192

"https://langfuse.com/open-source", "title": "Langfuse's Open-Source Strategy - Langfuse", "text": "Langfuse\u2019s Open-Source Strategy\nLangfuse is built in the open. We believe open source and sustainable commercialization can coexist\u2014and this strategy is how we fund continuous, community-driven innovation that\u2019s adopted across startups and enterprises.\nDo you have any questions? Please reach out to the maintainers via GitHub Discussions.\nAll product capabilities\u2014tracing, evaluations, prompt management, experiments, annotation, the playground, and more\u2014are MIT licensed without any usage limits. Enterprise modules such as SCIM, audit logging, and data retention policies require a commercial license when you self-host Langfuse.\nWhy is Langfuse open source?\n- Transparency & Trust: Developers can inspect every line that handles their data, audit security practices, and avoid vendor lock-in.\n- Community Collaboration: The open source community moves quickly and accelerates integrations with LangChain, LiteLLM, OpenTelemetry, and the next library you\u2019ll build tomorrow. Join our community on GitHub Discussions to shape the roadmap.\n- Faster Innovation: Shared ownership means bugs are squashed and features land sooner.\n- Sovereignty: You can run Langfuse anywhere \u2014 from your laptop to an air-gapped cluster \u2014 without hitting artificial usage caps. Self-host it on your own infrastructure.\n- Extensible: All data is accessible via the public API which is fully tested. You can wrap/extend Langfuse or build your own workflows and AI platform around it.\nLicensing Overview\nSelf-hosting keeps data within your infrastructure; Cloud offloads operational overhead. Because every deployment runs the same codebase and schema, you can switch between OSS, Enterprise self-host, and Langfuse Cloud at any time. Add or remove a license key or switch to the Langfuse Cloud endpoints. No feature flags to untangle, no vendor lock-in, and no downtime.\nLangfuse OSS\nLangfuse\u2019s OSS includes all product features and has no usage limits. Fork it, extend it, ship it\u2014even in commercial products. All core APIs and backend logic scale horizontally out-of-the-box, so the same deployment can grow from a single-node Docker Compose to a multi-node Kubernetes cluster\u2014without code changes or feature gates. It\u2019s the same architecture that powers Langfuse Cloud.\nCommercial Extensions\nEnterprise Edition (EE) modules live in clearly marked /ee\ndirectories. These are shipped as source code, but require a license key to run. They are optional; the core works 100% without them.\nArchitecture Consistency & Scale\nThe Langfuse deployment stack is exactly the same for OSS, Enterprise self-host, and Langfuse Cloud. See our Self-Hosting Guide for instructions on running Langfuse locally and deployments at production scale.\nArchitecture\nLangfuse consists of two application containers, storage components, and an optional LLM API/Gateway.\n- Application Containers\n- Langfuse Web: The main web application serving the Langfuse UI and APIs.\n- Langfuse Worker: A worker that asynchronously processes events.\n- Storage Components:\n- Postgres: The main database for transactional workloads.\n- Clickhouse: High-performance OLAP database which stores traces, observations, and scores.\n- Redis/Valkey cache: A fast in-memory data structure store. Used for queue and cache operations.\n- S3/Blob Store: Object storage to persist all incoming events, multi-modal inputs, and large exports.\n- LLM API / Gateway: Some features depend on an external LLM API or gateway.\nLangfuse can be deployed within a VPC or on-premises in high-security environments. Internet access is optional. See networking documentation for more details.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIs Langfuse really open source?\nYes. Everything outside the /ee\nfolders is MIT-licensed \u2014 an OSI-approved license. You get the four freedoms: use, study, modify, distribute.\nWill I accidentally use EE features?\nNo. EE packages are isolated and gated by the license key check. You can run the core image without a key without running EE code.\nWhich self-host licensing options exist?\nAll product features are freely available under the MIT license. A commercial Enterprise license is only required for advanced security capabilities such as SCIM, extended audit logging, and data retention policies (see pricing page).\nUpgrading is as simple as setting LANGFUSE_EE_LICENSE_KEY\n(docs) in your deployment; containers pick up the change at runtime.\nDoes Langfuse rely only on open-source components?\nYes. The entire stack is open source and can be self-hosted. Find a complete list in the configuration files across our repositories:\n- Langfuse server: monorepo with multiple\npackage.json\nfiles - Langfuse Python SDK: main\npyproject.toml\n- Langfuse JS SDK: monorepo with multiple\npackage.json\nfiles\nAs the core Langfuse server is most actively developed, we run an automated license check on every change to avoid adding dependencies with non-permissive licenses. If you find any issues, please let us know.\nWhat\u2019s the release cadence and how do I stay up to date?\nWe cut a GitHub Release multiple times a week (tagged vX.Y.Z\n) and publish detailed notes in the changelog. Langfuse Cloud is always running the latest version; self-host users can pull the identical Docker image tag to stay up to date or upgrade on their own schedule (docs).\nDoes the OSS build phone home? Can I disable telemetry?\nBy default, Langfuse reports aggregated usage analytics (no personal data) so we know which features matter. No traces, prompts, or customer data leave your cluster. You can opt out of this.\nCan I run Langfuse completely offline / air-gapped?\nYes. After the initial image pull, Langfuse does not require any outbound network calls to work. Teams in regulated environments run it inside air-gapped Kubernetes clusters; just disable telemetry as above and mirror the Docker registry locally.\nHow do I contribute?\nHere are the best ways to contribute to Langfuse via GitHub:\n- Submit and vote on Ideas.\n- Create and comment on Issues.\n- Create a pull request. See Contributing.md to get started.\nI want to see the code!\nAll our repositories are on GitHub:\n- Langfuse Server (UI and API):\nlangfuse/langfuse\n- Langfuse Python SDK and integrations:\nlangfuse/langfuse-python\n- JS SDK and integrations:\nlangfuse/langfuse-js\n- Docs:\nlangfuse/langfuse-docs\nCan you share some public metrics on how widely Langfuse is used?\nSure, we summarized some statistics in this blog post and in the dashboard below.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192

We now have two offices, a larger one in Berlin, Germany (with a focus on product & engineering) and a smaller one in San Francisco (with a focus on marketing & sales).

This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a \u201cdata processor\u201d on behalf of our customers.

If you want to know more about our customers\u2019 privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.\nIf you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.\nWe may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent).

How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?\nIn Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.\nWe have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

Controls for Do-Not-Track Features\nMost web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.

aligned with HIPAA, enabling healthcare organizations and partners to use Langfuse while adhering to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Langfuse offers a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) to cover the safeguarding of Protected Health Information (PHI).\nFor questions regarding HIPAA compliance, please contact [email protected].\nHow to get set up on Langfuse HIPAA Cloud\n- You need a fresh Langfuse Cloud account. (Data migration is possible, please use the data migration cookbook)\n- Sign up to hipaa.cloud.langfuse.com\n- Review BAA below\n- Upgrade to Pro plan or Higher\n- BAA applies automatically\n- You\u2019re good to go!\nDownload Langfuse BAA as a PDF\n- Download Langfuse BAA\nLangfuse Business Associate Agreement (BAA)\nLatest revision: 29 April 2025\nEffective automatically for eligible accounts\nImportant Eligibility Notice\nThis Business Associate Agreement (\u201cBAA\u201d) automatically applies only to Langfuse customer accounts that:\n- are hosted in the Langfuse HIPAA Cloud Region at https://hipaa.cloud.langfuse.com; and\n- are subscribed to a Pro, Teams, or Enterprise plan (each a \u201cHIPAA\u2011Eligible Plan\u201d).\nAccounts that do not meet both conditions are not covered by this BAA and may not process Protected Health Information (\u201cPHI\u201d) with Langfuse.\nBy provisioning or continuing to use an eligible account, the entity identified in the Langfuse billing records (\u201cCustomer\u201d, \u201cCovered Entity\u201d or its own business associate under HIPAA) is deemed to have read, understood and agreed to this BAA. No separate checkbox, click\u2011through or signature is required.\nThe current and past versions of this BAA is always available at https://langfuse.com/baa. Questions? Email [email protected].\n1 Parties & Incorporation\nThis BAA supplements and is incorporated by reference into the Langfuse Cloud Master Subscription Agreement (MSA), Order Form and/or any other written contract governing Customer\u2019s use of the HIPAA\u2011eligible Langfuse Environment (collectively, the \u201cServices Agreement\u201d). If any conflict arises between this BAA and the Services Agreement with respect to PHI processed in the HIPAA Cloud Region, this BAA controls.\n2 Definitions\nCapitalized terms have the meanings set out in the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (45 C.F.R. Parts 160 & 164), as amended by the HITECH Act (together, \u201cHIPAA\u201d). Key terms include:\nOther HIPAA terms (e.g., Designated Record Set, Unsecured PHI, Subcontractor) have the same meanings given in HIPAA.\n3 Permitted Uses & Disclosures\nLangfuse may use or disclose PHI only:\n- To provide the HIPAA Cloud Region environment and related support in accordance with the Services Agreement;\n- For our own management or legal obligations, provided any disclosure is (i) required by law or (ii) to a recipient that agrees to written confidentiality protections and promptly reports any breach; and\n- As otherwise required by law.\nLangfuse will not use or disclose PHI for any other purpose without Customer\u2019s written instruction.\n4 Customer Responsibilities\nCustomer represents, warrants and agrees that:\n- Status. Customer is, and will remain, a Covered Entity or Business Associate under HIPAA and will comply with HIPAA in its use of the Services.\n- Minimum\u2011Necessary & Configuration. Customer will (a) limit PHI uploaded to the Service to the minimum necessary, (b) refrain from sending PHI via support tickets, email, or non\u2011HIPAA workspaces, and (c) follow Langfuse documentation regarding encryption and other HIPAA configuration.\n- No Impermissible Requests. Customer will not request Langfuse to use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate HIPAA if performed by Customer.\n- Consents. Customer is responsible for obtaining any authorisations or consents required for Langfuse\u2019s uses and disclosures of PHI.\nLangfuse may rely on Customer\u2019s instructions when assessing the minimum\u2011necessary standard.\n5 Safeguards\nLangfuse will:\n- Implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI in accordance with the HIPAA Security Rule;\n- Maintain a written information\u2011security program including risk assessments, encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, logging and vulnerability management; and\n- Ensure that workforce members with access to PHI are bound by confidentiality obligations and trained on HIPAA requirements.\n6 Subcontractors\nLangfuse will ensure that any Subcontractor that creates, receives, maintains or transmits PHI on Langfuse\u2019s behalf agrees, in writing, to restrictions and security obligations at least as protective as those in this BAA and the HIPAA Security Rule.\n7 Incident & Breach Reporting\nLangfuse will:\n- Report to Customer any Breach of Unsecured PHI or unauthorised use or disclosure of PHI without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 72 hours after discovery;\n- Report Security Incidents that materially compromise PHI; and\n- Provide available information to assist Customer in complying with 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7164.404\u2013410.\nUnsuccessful intrusion attempts (e.g., port scans, failed log\u2011ins, firewall pings) are commonplace and do not require notice under this section.\n8 Individual Rights\nWhere Customer maintains PHI in a Designated Record Set within the HIPAA Cloud Region, Langfuse will, at Customer\u2019s request and within the timeframes required by HIPAA:\n- Provide access to PHI (45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.524);\n- Incorporate amendments to PHI (45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.526); and\n- Provide disclosure logs for accountings (45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.528).\nFees may apply for non\u2011routine assistance.\n9 Books & Records\nLangfuse will make its relevant policies, procedures and records relating to the security or use of PHI available to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services upon request, subject to attorney\u2011client privilege and trade\u2011secret protections.\n10 Term & Termination\nTerm. This BAA becomes effective automatically when Customer first creates or upgrades an account that satisfies the eligibility criteria described in the Important Eligibility Notice and remains in effect until the earlier of (a) termination or downgrade of the Services Agreement or applicable plan, or (b) Customer\u2019s cessation of use of the HIPAA Cloud Region.\nTermination for Breach. Either party may terminate this BAA on 30 days\u2019 written notice if the other materially breaches it and fails to cure within that period.\nReturn/Destruction of PHI. Upon termination, Langfuse will return or destroy all PHI within 30 days. If return or destruction is infeasible, Langfuse will continue to protect the PHI and limit further uses and disclosures.\n11 Miscellaneous\n- No Third\u2011Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this BAA confers rights on anyone other than the parties.\n- Amendment. If HIPAA is amended, the parties will update this BAA as needed to remain compliant. Langfuse may update this BAA prospectively by posting a revised version and providing at least 30 days\u2019 notice; continued use of the HIPAA Cloud Region after the effective date constitutes acceptance.\n- Liability. Each party\u2019s liability under this BAA is subject to the limitations in the Services Agreement, except that HIPAA fines imposed due to a party\u2019s breach are borne by that party.\n- Governing Law. Unless the Services Agreement states otherwise, this BAA is governed by the same law and dispute forum as the Services Agreement.", "links": [{"href":

Langfuse", "text": "TypeScript SDK - Instrumentation\nTo instrument your application to send traces to Langfuse, you can use\n- Native instrumentation of llm/agent libraries for out-of-the-box tracing\n- Custom instrumentation methods for fine-grained control\n- Context manager:\nstartActiveObservation\n- Wrapper:\nobserve\n- Manual:\nstartObservation\n- Context manager:\nThese components are interoperable. Please refer to this API route handler, which powers langfuse.com/demo, as an example of how to combine the auto-instrumentation of the AI SDK V5 with custom instrumentation. This approach captures more details and groups multiple LLM calls into a single trace.\nNative instrumentation\nLangfuse integrates with many llm/agent libraries to automatically trace your application. For a full list, see the Langfuse Integrations page.\nThese are the most popular ones:\nThe @langfuse/openai\npackage provides a wrapper to automatically trace calls to the OpenAI SDK.\nFor an end-to-end example, see the Langfuse + OpenAI JS/TS Cookbook.\nInstallation:\nnpm install @langfuse/openai\nUsage:\nThe observeOpenAI\nfunction wraps your OpenAI client instance. All subsequent API calls made with the wrapped client will be traced as generations and nested automatically in the current trace tree. If there\u2019s no active trace in context, a new one will be created automatically.\nimport { OpenAI } from \"openai\";\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \"@langfuse/openai\";\n// Instantiate the OpenAI client as usual\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n// Wrap it with Langfuse\nconst tracedOpenAI = observeOpenAI(openai, {\n// Pass trace-level attributes that will be applied to all calls\ntraceName: \"my-openai-trace\",\nsessionId: \"user-session-123\",\nuserId: \"user-abc\",\ntags: [\"openai-integration\"],\n});\n// Use the wrapped client just like the original\nconst completion = await tracedOpenAI.chat.completions.create({\nmodel: \"gpt-4\",\nmessages: [{ role: \"user\", content: \"What is OpenTelemetry?\" }],\n});\nCustom instrumentation\nYou can add custom instrumentations to your application via\n- the\nobserve\nwrapper startActiveObservation\ncontext managers- manually managing the observation lifecycle and its nesting with the\nstartObservation\nfunction\nFor an end-to-end example, see the JS Instrumentation Cookbook.\nContext management with callbacks\nTo simplify nesting and context management, you can use startActiveObservation\n. These functions take a callback and automatically manage the observation\u2019s lifecycle and the OpenTelemetry context. Any observation created inside the callback will automatically be nested under the active observation, and the observation will be ended when the callback finishes.\nThis is the recommended approach for most use cases as it prevents context leakage and ensures observations are properly ended.\nimport { startActiveObservation, startObservation } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\nawait startActiveObservation(\n// name\n\"user-request\",\n// callback\nasync (span) => {\nspan.update({\ninput: { query: \"What is the capital of France?\" },\n});\n// Example child, could also use startActiveObservation\n// This manually created generation (see docs below) will automatically be a child of \"user-request\"\nconst generation = startObservation(\n\"llm-call\",\n{\nmodel: \"gpt-4\",\ninput: [{ role: \"user\", content: \"What is the capital of France?\" }],\n},\n{ asType: \"generation\" }\n);\ngeneration.update({\nusageDetails: { input: 10, output: 5 },\noutput: { content: \"The capital of France is Paris.\" },\n});\ngeneration.end();\nspan.update({ output: \"Successfully answered.\" });\n}\n);\nobserve\nwrapper\nThe observe\nwrapper is a powerful tool for tracing existing functions without modifying their internal logic. It acts as a decorator that automatically creates a span or generation around the function call. You can use the updateActiveObservation\nfunction to add attributes to the observation from within the wrapped function.\nimport { observe, updateActiveObservation } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\n// An existing function\nasync function fetchData(source: string) {\nupdateActiveObservation({ metadata: { source: \"API\" } });\n// ... logic to fetch data\nreturn { data: `some data from ${source}` };\n}\n// Wrap the function to trace it\nconst tracedFetchData = observe(\n// method\nfetchData,\n// options, optional, see below\n{}\n);\n// Now, every time you call tracedFetchData, a span is created.\n// Its input and output are automatically populated with the\n// function's arguments and return value.\nconst result = await tracedFetchData(\"API\");\nYou can configure the observe\nwrapper by passing an options object as the second argument:\nManual observations\nThe core tracing function (startObservation\n) gives you full control over creating observations. You can pass the asType\noption to specify the type of observation to create.\nWhen you call one of these functions, the new observation is automatically linked as a child of the currently active operation in the OpenTelemetry context. However, it does not make this new observation the active one. This means any further operations you trace will still be linked to the original parent, not the one you just created.\nTo create nested observations manually, use the methods on the returned object (e.g., parentSpan.startObservation(...)\n).\nimport { startObservation } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\n// Start a root span for a user request\nconst span = startObservation(\n// name\n\"user-request\",\n// params\n{\ninput: { query: \"What is the capital of France?\" },\n}\n);\n// Create a nested span for a e.g. tool call\nconst toolCall = span.startObservation(\n// name\n\"fetch-weather\",\n// params\n{\ninput: { city: \"Paris\" },\n},\n// Specify observation type in asType\n// This will type the attributes argument accordingly\n// Default is 'span'\n{ asType: \"tool\" }\n);\n// Simulate work and end the tool call span\nawait new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));\ntoolCall.update({ output: { temperature: \"15\u00b0C\" } }).end();\n// Create a nested generation for the LLM call\nconst generation = span.startObservation(\n\"llm-call\",\n{\nmodel: \"gpt-4\",\ninput: [{ role: \"user\", content: \"What is the capital of France?\" }],\n},\n{ asType: \"generation\" }\n);\ngeneration.update({\nusageDetails: { input: 10, output: 5 },\noutput: { content: \"The capital of France is Paris.\" },\n});\ngeneration.end();\n// End the root span\nspan.update({ output: \"Successfully answered user request.\" }).end();\nIf you use startObservation()\n, you are responsible for calling .end()\non\nthe returned observation object. Failure to do so will result in incomplete or\nmissing observations in Langfuse.\nUpdating Traces\nOften, you might not have all the information about a trace (like a userId\nor sessionId\n) when you start it. The SDK lets you add or update trace-level attributes at any point during its execution.\n.updateTrace()\non an observation\nWhen you create an observation manually with startObservation\n, the returned object has an .updateTrace()\nmethod. You can call this at any time before the root span ends to apply attributes to the entire trace.\nimport { startObservation } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\n// Start a trace without knowing the user yet\nconst rootSpan = startObservation(\"data-processing\");\n// ... some initial steps ...\n// Later, once the user is authenticated, update the trace\nconst userId = \"user-123\";\nconst sessionId = \"session-abc\";\nrootSpan.updateTrace({\nuserId: userId,\nsessionId: sessionId,\ntags: [\"authenticated-user\"],\nmetadata: { plan: \"premium\" },\n});\n// ... continue with the rest of the trace ...\nconst generation = rootSpan.startObservation(\n\"llm-call\",\n{},\n{ asType: \"generation\" }\n);\ngeneration.end();\nrootSpan.end();\nupdateActiveTrace()\nWhen you\u2019re inside a callback from startActiveObservation\n, or a function wrapped with observe\n, you might not have a direct reference to an observation object. In these cases, use the updateActiveTrace()\nfunction. It automatically finds the currently active trace in the context and applies the new attributes.\nimport { startActiveObservation, updateActiveTrace } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\nawait startActiveObservation(\"user-request\", async (span) => {\n// Initial part of the request\nspan.update({ input: { path: \"/api/process\" } });\n// Simulate fetching user data\nawait new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 50));\nconst user = { id: \"user-5678\", name: \"Jane Doe\" };\n// Update the active trace with the user's information\nupdateActiveTrace({\nuserId: user.id,\nmetadata: { userName: user.name },\n});\n// ... continue logic ...\nspan.update({ output: { status: \"success\" } }).end();\n});", "links": [{"href":

"TypeScript SDK - Overview\nThe modular Langfuse TypeScript SDK (v4) is built on OpenTelemetry for robust observability, better context management, and easy integration with third-party libraries.\nThis documentation is for the TypeScript SDK v4. If you are looking for the documentation for the TypeScript SDK v3, please click here.\nIf you are self-hosting Langfuse, the TypeScript SDK v4 requires Langfuse platform version \u2265 3.95.0 for all features to work correctly.\nQuickstart\nGet your first trace into Langfuse in just a few minutes.\nInstall packages\nInstall the relevant packages to get started with tracing:\nnpm install @langfuse/tracing @langfuse/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-node\nLearn more about the packages here.\nSet up environment variables\nAdd your Langfuse credentials to your environment variables. Make sure that you have a .env\nfile in your project root and a package like dotenv\nto load the variables.\nLANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY = \"sk-lf-...\"\nLANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY = \"pk-lf-...\"\nLANGFUSE_BASE_URL = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa EU region\n# LANGFUSE_BASE_URL = \"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\" # \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US region\nSet up OpenTelemetry\nCreate a file named instrumentation.ts\nto initialize the OpenTelemetry SDK. The LangfuseSpanProcessor\nis the key component that sends traces to Langfuse.\nimport { NodeSDK } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\";\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \"@langfuse/otel\";\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\nspanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()],\n});\nsdk.start();\nImport the instrumentation.ts\nfile at the very top of your application\u2019s entry point (e.g., index.ts\n).\nimport \"./instrumentation\"; // Must be the first import\nLearn more about setting up OpenTelemetry here.\nInstrument your application\nUse one of the native Langfuse framework integrations to automatically trace your application.\nAlternatively, manually instrument your application, e.g. by using the startActiveObservation\n. This function takes a callback and automatically manages the observation\u2019s lifecycle and the OpenTelemetry context. Any observation created inside the callback will automatically be nested under the active observation, and the observation will be ended when the callback finishes.\nThis is just an example, check out the instrumentation page for more details.\nimport \"./instrumentation\";\nimport { startActiveObservation } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\nasync function main() {\nawait startActiveObservation(\"my-first-trace\", async (span) => {\nspan.update({\ninput: \"Hello, Langfuse!\",\noutput: \"This is my first trace!\",\n});\n});\n}\nmain();\nRun your application\nExecute your application. You should see your trace appear in the Langfuse UI.\nnpx tsx index.ts\nPackages\nThe Langfuse SDK is designed to be modular. Here\u2019s an overview of the available packages:\nOpenTelemetry foundation\nBuilding on OpenTelemetry is a core design choice for this SDK. It offers several key advantages:\n- Standardization: It aligns with the industry standard for observability, making it easier to integrate with existing monitoring and APM tools.\n- Robust Context Management: OpenTelemetry provides reliable context propagation, ensuring that traces are correctly linked even in complex, asynchronous applications.\n- Ecosystem & Interoperability: You can leverage a vast ecosystem of third-party instrumentations. If a library you use supports OpenTelemetry, its traces can be sent to Langfuse automatically.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor":

Langfuse", "text": "TypeScript SDK - Upgrade Path v3 to v4\nPlease follow each section below to upgrade your application from v3 to v4.\nIf you encounter any questions or issues while upgrading, please raise an issue on GitHub.\nTracing\nThe v4 SDK tracing is a major rewrite based on OpenTelemetry and introduces several breaking changes.\n- OTEL-based Architecture: The SDK is now built on top of OpenTelemetry. An OpenTelemetry Setup is required now and done by registering the\nLangfuseSpanProcessor\nwith an OpenTelemetryNodeSDK\n. - New Tracing Functions: The\nlangfuse.trace()\n,langfuse.span()\n, andlangfuse.generation()\nmethods have been replaced bystartObservation\n,startActiveObservation\n, etc., from the@langfuse/tracing\npackage. - Separation of Concerns:\n- The\n@langfuse/tracing\nand@langfuse/otel\npackages are for tracing. - The\n@langfuse/client\npackage and theLangfuseClient\nclass are now only for non-tracing features like scoring, prompt management, and datasets.\n- The\nSee the SDK v4 docs for details on each.\nPrompt Management\n-\nImport: The import of the Langfuse client is now:\nimport { LangfuseClient } from \"@langfuse/client\";\n-\nUsage: The usage of the Langfuse client is now:\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient(); const prompt = await langfuse.prompt.get(\"my-prompt\"); const compiledPrompt = prompt.compile({ topic: \"developers\" }); const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({ model: \"gpt-4o\", messages: [{ role: \"user\", content: compiledPrompt }], });\n-\nversion\nis now an optional property of the options object oflangfuse.prompt.get()\ninstead of a positional argument.const prompt = await langfuse.prompt.get(\"my-prompt\", { version: \"1.0\" });\nOpenAI integration\n-\nImport: The import of the OpenAI integration is now:\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \"@langfuse/openai\";\n-\nYou can set the\nenvironment\nandrelease\nnow via theLANGFUSE_TRACING_ENVIRONMENT\nandLANGFUSE_TRACING_RELEASE\nenvironment variables.\nVercel AI SDK\nWorks very similarly to v3, but replaces LangfuseExporter\nfrom langfuse-vercel\nwith the regular LangfuseSpanProcessor\nfrom @langfuse/otel\n.\nPlease see full example on usage with the AI SDK for more details.\nLangchain integration\n-\nImport: The import of the Langchain integration is now:\nimport { CallbackHandler } from \"@langfuse/langchain\";\n-\nYou can set the\nenvironment\nandrelease\nnow via theLANGFUSE_TRACING_ENVIRONMENT\nandLANGFUSE_TRACING_RELEASE\nenvironment variables.\nlangfuseClient.getTraceUrl\n-\nmethod is now asynchronous and returns a promise\nconst traceUrl = await langfuseClient.getTraceUrl(traceId);\nScoring\n-\nImport: The import of the Langfuse client is now:\nimport { LangfuseClient } from \"@langfuse/client\";\n-\nUsage: The usage of the Langfuse client is now:\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient(); await langfuse.score.create({ traceId: \"trace_id_here\", name: \"accuracy\", value: 0.9, });\nSee custom scores documentation for new scoring methods.\nDatasets\nSee datasets documentation for new dataset methods.", "links": [{"href":

is a critical aspect of developing and deploying LLM applications. Usually, teams use a multitude of different evaluation methods to score the performance of their AI application depending on the use case and the stage of the development process.\nWatch this walkthrough of Langfuse Evaluation and how to use it to improve your LLM application.\nWhy use LLM Evaluation?\nLLM evaluation is crucial for improving the accuracy and robustness of language models, ultimately enhancing the user experience and trust in your AI application. Here are the key benefits:\n- Quality Assurance: Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\n- Performance Monitoring: Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\n- Continuous Improvement: Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\n- User Trust: Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic evaluation\n- Risk Mitigation: Catch potential issues before they reach production users, reducing the likelihood of poor user experiences or reputational damage\nOnline & Offline Evaluation\nOffline Evaluation involves\n- Evaluating the application in a controlled setting\n- Typically using curated test Datasets instead of live user queries\n- Heavily used during development (can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to measure improvements / regressions\n- Repeatable and you can get clear accuracy metrics since you have ground truth.\nOnline Evaluation involves\n- Evaluating the application in a live, real-world environment, i.e. during actual usage in production.\n- Use Evaluation Methods that track success rates, user satisfaction scores, or other metrics on live traffic\n- Advantage of online evaluation is that it captures things you might not anticipate in a lab setting\n- Can include collecting implicit and explicit user feedback, and possibly running shadow tests or A/B tests\nIn practice, successful evaluation blends online and offline evaluations. Many teams adopt a loop-like approach. This way, evaluation is continuous and ever-improving.\nAdapted from: \u201cHow to continuously improve LLM products?\u201d, Evidently\nCore Concepts\nEvaluation Methods\nEvaluation methods are functions or tools to assign evaluation Score\ns to other objects. Langfuse uses the Scores to store evaluation metrics, it is meant to be flexible to represent any evaluation metric.\nLangfuse currently supports: automatic scoring through LLM-as-a-Judge, manual Human Annotations or fully Custom Scoring via API/SDKs. We keep adding more evaluation methods fast, so stay tuned!\nLearn more about the Scores Data Model.\nDataset Runs\nDataset Runs are used to loop your LLM application through Datasets and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results. This lets you strategically evaluate your application and compare the performance of different inputs, prompts, models, or other parameters side-by-side against controlled conditions.\nIn Langfuse we differentiate between Native vs. Remote Dataset Runs. Native Dataset Runs rely on Dataset, Prompts and optionally LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluators all being on the Langfuse platform. Remote Dataset Runs rely only on Datasets being on the Langfuse platform, prompts and evaluation methods can be managed off platform \u2013 they are run via code.\nAll require managing the Datasets on the Langfuse platform.\nLearn more about the Dataset Runs Data Model.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192

Quality is assessed over time as well as across prompt versions, LLMs and users.\n- Cost and Latency are accurately measured and broken down by user, session, geography, feature, model and prompt version.\n- Volume based on the ingested traces and tokens used.\nDimensions:\n- Trace name: differentiate between different use cases, features, etc. by adding a\nname\nfield to your traces. - User: track usage and cost by user. Just add a\nuserId\nto your traces (docs). - Tags: filter different use cases, features, etc. by adding tags to your traces.\n- Release and version numbers: track how changes to the LLM application

Global Payments Company SumUp rolled out AI-Powered Support for 4 million merchants across 35+ markets building on Langfuse\nAbout SumUp\nSumUp is a leading global fintech company trusted by over 4 million merchants in more than 35+ markets worldwide. It stands out by making card payments easy and accessible for small businesses, offering simple, reliable hardware and software solutions within a comprehensive multipillar ecosystem of financial solutions.\nThe Challenge\nThe mission was simple: empower SumUp\u2019s merchant support teams with an AI assistant as the first entry point for all customer support requests. The challenge was far from trivial.\nMulti-market complexity and scale: SumUp\u2019s merchant support serves over 4 million merchants across 35+ markets with market-specific differences in requirements.\nSecurity & Privacy: SumUp operates in Financial Services, data privacy and security are of paramount importance and had to be maintained throughout the project.\nSystems Integration: Conversations within SumUp\u2019s customers are complex and require follow-ups and clarifications, as well as querying a variety of systems. The implementation had to model highly complex LLM interactions and tool uses.\nSolution: multiple layers of AI empowerment\nMerchant facing with hybrid support model: AI assistant that answers first line of questions & routes the conversation to humans if necessary.\nInternal: Self-built AI Translation tools allow support agents to help merchants in languages other than their own & AI Agent Copilot that helps agents find most relevant resources, drafting answers and reducing handling time.\nRollout\nSumUp handled their market rollout strategically and incrementally. Here is how SumUp rolled out AI-Powered Support to 35+ markets within 18 months successfully.\nExpansion Strategy\n- Begin with English-speaking markets (Ireland and UK)\n- Focus on smaller volume merchants first\n- Slowly increase volume while monitoring reliability metrics\n- Expanded based on improved performance versus previous solution.\n- Extend to markets with no previous existing Bot support\nHow SumUp is using Langfuse\nIn early PoC stages of the project, SumUp got started quickly with using Langfuse Self-Hosting \u2013 no tedious vendor onboarding & evaluation before having a better understanding of project requirements and needs. Once the system got closer to production and full rollout, the team happily switched over to let Langfuse Cloud do the grunt work of making the systems run reliably.\nTracing was the clear starting point of implementation. Yet, during the project the team has set up elaborate multi-team workflows powered by Langfuse to enable continuous development & monitoring of 25 users across Engineering, Support Operations, Content, Q&A and other stakeholders.\n\"Projects like ours often start from an Engineering perspective. Langfuse gave us full observability and asynchronous debugging powers out of the box. If anyone builds an LLM application they should start with that.\nTracing: Deep Visibility Across Teams:\nLangfuse Observability & Tracing gives SumUp a unified view on all LLM inputs, tool uses and outputs across functions. Engineers can run very detailed asynchronous debugging. Content owners understand shortcomings of LLM inputs & context documents. Q&A has full visibility in output quality.\nPrompt Management & Playground: Fast Iteration & Empowering Non-Technical Staff\nPrompt management lets business teams and engineers alike iterate and test prompt changes in production really fast. The system is integrated with a self-built set of evaluators to test new iterations automatically. The Playground lets SumUp reproduce exact production configs, variables and tool integrations from production traces into a simple UI to quickly iterate on prompt improvements before implementing them. Reproducing the exact production environment was very time consuming for engineers and impossible for non-technical staff before using Langfuse.\nBusiness Impact\n\"Building on Langfuse we have achieved a 50% deflection rate of conversations that don't go to humans. That is 300,000 monthly merchant requests that no longer require human support \u2013 that\u2019s 10,000 per day! Even though merchant numbers grow fast; we can focus our resources on more valuable challenges.\nPoC to 35+ markets success\nWhat started with one market and low volume merchants was successfully rolled out over 18 months to 35+ markets supporting over 4 million merchants.\nScalability, Quality & Speed\nScaling AI-powered first level merchant support from 1,000 to 600,000 monthly conversations leading not to worse but to actually better merchant experiences through much faster responses. It translates direct value for the merchants and stronger loyalty towards SumUp.\nOperational Excellence & Cost Reduction\nThe implementation has achieved a deflection rate of almost 50% which directly translates into a 30% cost reduction of external BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) cost.\nMulti-Team Collaboration\nLangfuse enables 25 users across engineering, content teams and Q&A to implement robust workflows for continuous process improvements on Langfuse. Especially empowering non-technical users to contribute to robust workflows really made the difference here.\nReady to get started with Langfuse?\nJoin thousands of teams building better LLM

Khanmigo AI - Langfuse", "text": "Khan Academy uses Langfuse\u2019s LLM Engineering platform to build Khanmigo AI\nHow Khan Academy uses Langfuse to debug and improve Khanmigo AI, a student tutor and teaching assistant.\nAbout Khan Academy\nKhan Academy is the beloved personalized learning system with over 150 million registered learners across 190 countries in 56 languages. It provides free online courses, lessons, and practice exercises covering subjects from elementary math to college-level topics like calculus, physics, economics, and computer science. Khan Academy also provides tools for teachers and parents to track student progress. Khan Academy\u2019s mission: \u201cA free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.\u201d\nPioneering AI in Education\nKhan Academy started their journey working with large language models in 2022 as an early access partner of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. They have learned many hard-won lessons and shipped dozens of cornerstone AI experiences led by their flagship AI product: Khanmigo.\nChallenge: Go-Based Infrastructure Meets AI\nRunning a nonprofit at this scale demands extreme resource efficiency.\nKhan Academy migrated to Go from Python2 starting in 2019. When it came time to implement AI observability, they faced a unique challenge. Most tracing tools required specific SDKs or wrappers that didn\u2019t fit their Go-based architecture.\n\u201cWhat we really loved about Langfuse was the open API,\u201d says Walt from Khan Academy\u2019s engineering team. \u201cWhile many tracing tools require specific SDKs or wrappers, Langfuse\u2019s open API enabled us to build our own Golang client around it. This was huge for our Go-based services.\u201d\nLLM Observability Across Product Teams\nSince deploying Langfuse in April 2024 as one of Langfuse\u2019s first enterprise customers, adoption has spread to over 100 users across 7 product and 4 infrastructure teams within Khan Academy. The platform isn\u2019t providing deep observability for just one AI feature but dozens of AI interactions across different products.\n\"Langfuse has really enabled our developers to get extremely fast feedback. When building and deploying features, we can quickly watch how those experiences are going. Langfuse is fundamental to how our developers understand their AI implementations.\nThe integration runs deep:\n- Internal UIs link directly to Langfuse traces for user experience analysis\n- Community support teams access traces for incident investigation\n- Engineers share Langfuse URLs for collaborative debugging\n- Senior leadership uses the platform for product decision analysis.\nResults: Speed Without Compromise\nFor Khan Academy, Langfuse solved multiple challenges simultaneously. The company avoided the engineering overhead of hosting their own tracing infrastructure while maintaining the flexibility to work within their Go ecosystem.\nStack Flexibility\nLangfuse plays well with Khan Academy's Go stack. They've built their custom Go client around the Langfuse API.\nDevelopment Speed\nDeep observability is the foundation for rapid iteration and debugging capabilities across products.\nHosting Simplicity\nThe nonprofit avoided the engineering overhead of hosting its own tracing infrastructure.\nPlatform across Teams\nDevelopment teams across the organization now share a common observability platform, preventing tool fragmentation.\n\"In early 2024, Langfuse was a big bet for us, and we've been overwhelmingly happy with that bet. Everything about choosing Langfuse has paid off in spades.\nReady to get started with Langfuse?\nJoin thousands of teams building better LLM applications with Langfuse's open-source observability

Observation Types for More Meaningful Span Context - Langfuse", "text": "\u2190 Back to changelog\nAugust 27, 2025\nAdditional Observation Types for More Meaningful Span Context\nNimar Blume\nNew observation types including Agent, Tool, Chain, Retriever, Evaluator, Embedding, and Guardrail provide semantic meaning to your traces.\nWe\u2019ve expanded the supported observation types to bring more meaning to your spans. Now, you can easily identify the type of action an observation represents, such as tool calls, embeddings or agents.\nFor most integrations with agent frameworks the observation types are automatically detected. You can also manually set them via the Langfuse SDK as explained in the docs.\nFull List of Available Observation Types:\n-\nevent\nis the basic building block. An event is used to track discrete events in a trace. -\nspan\nrepresents durations of units of work in a trace. -\ngeneration\nlogs generations of AI models incl. prompts, token usage and costs. -\nagent\ndecides on the application flow and can for example use tools with the guidance of a LLM. -\ntool\nrepresents a tool call, for example to a weather API. -\nchain\nis a link between different application steps, like passing context from a retriever to a LLM call. -\nretriever\nrepresents data retrieval steps, such as a call to a vector store or a database. -\nevaluator\nrepresents functions that assess relevance/correctness/helpfulness of a LLM\u2019s outputs. -\nembedding\nis a call to a LLM to generate embeddings and can include model, token usage and costs -\nguardrail\nis a component that protects against malicious content or jailbreaks.\nSetting new observation types requires Python SDK version>=3.3.1\n. Support\nfor the JS SDK will land in version\n4.0.\nLearn more\nWas this page helpful?", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK

It is a function decorator that can be applied to any function.\nIt sets the current span in the context for automatic nesting of child spans and automatically ends it when the function returns.

Please share any feedback or issues on GitHub.\n1. Install the Langfuse Docs MCP Server (optional)\nThe agent will use the Langfuse searchLangfuseDocs\ntool (docs) to find the correct documentation for the integration you are looking for. This is optional, alternatively the agent can use its native websearch capabilities.\nAdd Langfuse Docs MCP to Cursor via the one-click install:\nManual configuration\nAdd the following to your mcp.json\n:\n{\n\"mcpServers\": {\n\"langfuse-docs\": {\n\"url\": \"https://langfuse.com/api/mcp\"\n}\n}\n}\nAdd Langfuse Docs MCP to Copilot in VSCode via the following steps:\n- Open Command Palette (\u2318+Shift+P)\n- Open \u201cMCP: Add Server\u2026\u201d\n- Select\nHTTP\n- Paste\nhttps://langfuse.com/api/mcp\n- Select name (e.g.\nlangfuse-docs\n) and whether to save in user or workspace settings - You\u2019re all set! The MCP server is now available in Agent mode\nAdd Langfuse Docs MCP to Claude Code via the CLI:\nclaude mcp add \\\n--transport http \\\nlangfuse-docs \\\nhttps://langfuse.com/api/mcp \\\n--scope user\nManual configuration\nAlternatively, add the following to your settings file:\n- User scope:\n~/.claude/settings.json\n- Project scope:\nyour-repo/.claude/settings.json\n- Local scope:\nyour-repo/.claude/settings.local.json\n{\n\"mcpServers\": {\n\"langfuse-docs\": {\n\"transportType\": \"http\",\n\"url\": \"https://langfuse.com/api/mcp\",\n\"verifySsl\": true\n}\n}\n}\nOne-liner JSON import\nclaude mcp add-json langfuse-docs \\\n'{\"type\":\"http\",\"url\":\"https://langfuse.com/api/mcp\"}'\nOnce added, start a Claude Code session (claude\n) and type /mcp\nto confirm the connection.\nAdd Langfuse Docs MCP to Windsurf via the following steps:\n-\nOpen Command Palette (\u2318+Shift+P)\n-\nOpen \u201cMCP Configuration Panel\u201d\n-\nSelect\nAdd custom server\n-\nAdd the following configuration:\n{ \"mcpServers\": { \"langfuse-docs\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"mcp-remote\", \"https://langfuse.com/api/mcp\"] } } }\nLangfuse uses the streamableHttp\nprotocol to communicate with the MCP server. This is supported by most clients.\n{\n\"mcpServers\": {\n\"langfuse-docs\": {\n\"url\": \"https://langfuse.com/api/mcp\"\n}\n}\n}\nIf you use a client that does not support streamableHttp\n(e.g. Windsurf), you can use the mcp-remote\ncommand as a local proxy.\n{\n\"mcpServers\": {\n\"langfuse-docs\": {\n\"command\": \"npx\",\n\"args\": [\"mcp-remote\", \"https://langfuse.com/api/mcp\"]\n}\n}\n}\n2. Run Agent\nCopy and execute the following prompt in the agent mode of your editor:\nView prompt\n# Langfuse Agentic Onboarding ## Goals Your goal is to help me integrate Langfuse tracing into my codebase. ## Rules Before you begin, you must understand these three fundamental rules: 1. Do Not Change Business Logic: You are strictly forbidden from changing, refactoring, or altering any of my existing code's logic. Your only task is to add the necessary code for Langfuse integration, such as decorators, imports, handlers, and environment variable initializations. 2. Adhere to the Workflow: You must follow the step-by-step workflow outlined below in the exact sequence. 3. If available, use the langfuse-docs MCP server and the `searchLangfuseDocs` tool to retrieve information from the Langfuse docs. If it is not available, please use your websearch capabilities to find the information. ## Integration Workflow ### Step 1: Language and Compatibility Check First, analyze the codebase to identify the primary programming language. - If the language is Python or JavaScript/TypeScript, proceed to Step 2. - If the language is not Python or JavaScript/TypeScript, you must stop immediately. Inform me that the codebase is currently unsupported for this AI-based setup, and do not proceed further. ### Step 2: Codebase Discovery & Entrypoint Confirmation Once you have confirmed the language is compatible, explore the entire codebase to understand its purpose. - Identify all files and functions that contain LLM calls or are likely candidates for tracing. - Present this list of files and function names to me. - If you are unclear about the main entry point of the application (e.g., the primary API route or the main script to execute), you must ask me for confirmation on which parts are most critical to trace before proceeding to the next step. ### Step 3: Discover Available Integrations After I confirm the files and entry points, get a list of available integrations from the Langfuse docs by calling the `getLangfuseOverview` tool. ### Step 4: Analyze Confirmed Files for Technologies Based on the files we confirmed in Step 2, perform a deeper analysis to identify the specific LLM frameworks or SDKs being used (e.g., OpenAI SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Anthropic SDK, etc.). Search the Langfuse docs for the integration instructions for these frameworks via the `searchLangfuseDocs` tool. If you are unsure, repeatedly query the Langfuse docs via the `searchLangfuseDocs` tool. ### Step 5: Propose a Development Plan Before you write or modify a single line of code, you must present me with a clear, step-by-step development plan. This plan must include: - The Langfuse package(s) you will install. - The files you intend to modify. - The specific code changes you will make, showing the exact additions. - Instructions on where I will need to add my Langfuse API keys after your work is done. I will review this plan and give you my approval before you proceed. ### Step 6: Implement the Integration Once I approve your plan, execute it. First, you must use your terminal access to run the necessary package installation command (e.g., pip install langfuse, npm install langfuse) yourself. After the installation is successful, modify the code exactly as described in the plan. When done, please review the code changes. The goal here is to keep the integration as simple as possible. ### Step 7: Request User Review and Wait After you have made all the changes, notify me that your work is complete. Explicitly ask me to run the application and confirm that everything is working correctly and that you can make changes/improvements if needed. ### Step 8: Debug and Fix if Necessary If I report that something is not working correctly, analyze my feedback. Use the knowledge you have to debug the issue. If required, re-crawl the relevant Langfuse documentation to find a solution, propose a fix to me, and then implement it.\nExplore all integrations and frameworks that Langfuse supports.\nSee your trace in Langfuse\nAfter running your application, visit the Langfuse interface to view the trace you just created.

"text": "Observability Data Model\nTracing in Langfuse is a way to log and analyze the execution of your LLM applications. The following reference provides a detailed overview of the data model used. It is inspired by OpenTelemetry.\nTraces and Observations\nTraces\nA trace\ntypically represents a single request or operation.\nIt contains the overall input and output of the function, as well as metadata about the request ( i.e. user, session, tags, etc.).\nObservations\nEach trace can contain multiple observations\nto log the individual steps of the execution. Usually, a trace corresponds to a single api call of an application.\nNesting\nObservations can be nested manually or by leveraging the automatic OpenTelemetry context propagation.\nHierarchical structure of traces in Langfuse\nExample trace in Langfuse UI\nTypes\nLangfuse supports a number of LLM application specific observation types:\n-\nevent\nis the basic building block. An event is used to track discrete events in a trace. -\nspan\nrepresents durations of units of work in a trace. -\ngeneration\nlogs generations of AI models incl. prompts, token usage and costs. -\nagent\ndecides on the application flow and can for example use tools with the guidance of a LLM. -\ntool\nrepresents a tool call, for example to a weather API. -\nchain\nis a link between different application steps, like passing context from a retriever to a LLM call. -\nretriever\nrepresents data retrieval steps, such as a call to a vector store or a database. -\nevaluator\nrepresents functions that assess relevance/correctness/helpfulness of a LLM\u2019s outputs. -\nembedding\nis a call to a LLM to generate embeddings and can include model, token usage and costs -\nguardrail\nis a component that protects against malicious content or jailbreaks.\nSessions\nOptionally, traces can be grouped into sessions. Sessions are used to group traces that are part of the same user interaction. A common example is a thread in a chat interface.\nPlease refer to the Sessions documentation to add sessions to your traces.\nOptionally, sessions aggregate traces\nExample session in Langfuse UI\nScores\nScores are flexible objects used to evaluate traces, observations, sessions and dataset runs.\nThey can be:\n- Numeric, categorical, or boolean values\n- Associated with a trace, a session, or a dataset run (one and only one is required)\n- For trace level scores only: Linked to a specific observation within a trace (optional)\n- Annotated with comments for additional context\n- Validated against a score configuration schema (optional)\nTypically, session-level scores are used for comprehensive evaluation of conversational experiences across multiple interactions, while trace-level scores are used for evaluation of a single interaction. Dataset run level scores are used for overall evaluation of a dataset run, e.g. precision, recall, F1-score.\nPlease refer to the scores documentation to get started. For more details on score types and attributes, refer to the score data model documentation.\nBillable Units\nLangfuse Cloud pricing is based on the number of ingested units per billing period.\nUnits\n= Traces\n+ Observations\n+ Scores\nUse our pricing calculator to estimate your monthly costs based on your expected usage.\nFAQ\nHow can I track my Langfuse Cloud usage? Use the Usage Monitoring Report in the Dashboards tab in Langfuse to analyze your Langfuse Cloud usage.\nHow can I optimize my Langfuse Cloud usage to reduce cost?

This helps you:\n- Keep your development and production data separate while using the same project\n- Filter and analyze data by environment\n- Reuse datasets and prompts across environments\nYou can configure the environment by setting the LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENVIRONMENT\nenvironment variable (recommended) or by using the environment\nparameter in the client initialization.\nIf both are specified, the initialization parameter takes precedence.\nIf nothing is specified, the default environment is default\n.\nData Model\nThe environment\nattribute is available on all events in Langfuse:\n- Traces\n- Observations (spans, events, generations)\n- Scores\n- Sessions\nSee Data Model for more details.\nThe environment must be a string that follows this regex pattern: ^(?!langfuse)[a-z0-9-_]+$\nwith at most 40 characters.\nThis means:\n- Cannot start with \u201clangfuse\u201d\n- Can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores\nUsage\nfrom langfuse import get_client, observe\nimport os\n# Set the environment variable\n# Alternatively, set via .env file and load via dotenv\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENVIRONMENT\"] = \"production\"\n# Get the client (will use environment variable)\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# All operations will now be associated with the \"production\" environment\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"my-operation\") as span:\n# Your code here\npass\n@observe\ndef main():\nreturn \"Hello\"\nmain()\nFiltering\nIn the Langfuse UI, you can filter events by environment using the environment filter in the navigation bar. This filter applies across all views in Langfuse.\nSee our API Reference for details on how to filter by environment on our API.\nBest Practices\n- Consistent Environment Names: Use consistent environment names across your application to make filtering and analysis easier.\n- Environment-Specific Analysis: Use environments to analyze and compare metrics across different deployment stages.\n- Testing: Use separate environments for testing to avoid polluting production data.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor":

You can filter for tags in the Langfuse UI and GET API.\nWhen choosing tags, consider what aspects of the traces you might want to filter for or group by in your analysis. You may use tags to indicate specific versions of your app (\u2018app-v1\u2019, \u2018app-v2\u2019), specific LLM techniques you used (\u2018rag\u2019, \u2018one-shot\u2019, \u2018few-shot\u2019), or the environment of your app (\u2018local\u2019, \u2018staging\u2019, \u2018prod\u2019).

"https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/features/trace-ids-and-distributed-tracing", "title": "Trace IDs & Distributed Tracing - Langfuse", "text": "Trace IDs & Distributed Tracing\nLangfuse allows you to bring your own trace IDs (e.g., messageId, traceId, correlationId) for\n- distributed tracing\n- and linking traces across services for lookups between services.\n\ud83d\udca1\nBy default, Langfuse assigns random IDs (uuid, cuid) to all logged events. For the OTEL-based SDKs, Langfuse assigns random 32 hexchar trace IDs and 16 hexchar observation IDs.\nIt is recommended to use your own domain specific IDs (e.g., messageId, traceId, correlationId) as it helps with downstream use cases like:\n- deeplinking to the trace from your own ui or logs\n- evaluating and adding custom metrics to the trace\n- fetching the trace from the API\nData Model\nTrace IDs in Langfuse:\n- Must be unique within a project\n- Are used to identify and group related observations\n- Can be used for distributed tracing across services\n- Support upsert operations (creating or updating based on ID)\n- For the OTEL-based SDKs, trace IDs are 32 hexchar lowercase strings and observation IDs are 16 hexchar lowercase strings\nUsage\nThe Python SDK uses W3C Trace Context IDs by default, which are:\n- 32-character lowercase hexadecimal string for trace IDs\n- 16-character lowercase hexadecimal string for observation (span) IDs\nUsing the Decorator\nfrom langfuse import observe, get_client\nimport uuid\n@observe()\ndef process_user_request(user_id, request_data):\n# Function logic here\npass\n# Use custom trace ID by passing it as special keyword argument\nexternal_trace_id = \"custom-\" + str(uuid.uuid4())\n# Get a consistent trace ID for the same user\nlangfuse = get_client()\ntrace_id = langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_trace_id) # 32 hexchar lowercase string, deterministic with seed\nprocess_user_request(\nuser_id=\"user_123\",\nrequest_data={\"query\": \"hello\"},\nlangfuse_trace_id=trace_id\n)\nDeterministic Trace IDs\nYou can generate deterministic trace IDs from any string using create_trace_id()\n:\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Generate deterministic trace ID from an external ID\nexternal_id = \"request_12345\"\ntrace_id = langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_id)\n# Use this trace ID in a span\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(\nname=\"process-request\",\ntrace_context={\"trace_id\": trace_id}\n) as span:\n# Your code here\npass\nManually Creating Spans with Custom Trace Context\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Use a predefined trace ID with trace_context parameter\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(\nname=\"my-operation\",\ntrace_context={\n\"trace_id\": \"abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890\", # Must be 32 hex chars\n\"parent_span_id\": \"fedcba0987654321\" # Optional, 16 hex chars\n}\n) as span:\nprint(f\"This span has trace_id: {span.trace_id}\")\n# Your code here\nAccessing Current Trace ID\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"outer-operation\") as span:\n# Access the trace ID of the current span\ncurrent_trace_id = langfuse.get_current_trace_id()\ncurrent_span_id = langfuse.get_current_observation_id()\nprint(f\"Current trace ID: {current_trace_id}\")\nWas this page

This feature facilitates collaboration by allowing team members to:\n- Flag issues or anomalies in specific traces\n- Share insights about particular model outputs\n- Document edge cases and debugging notes\n- Coordinate on prompt improvements\n- Leave feedback during development and review cycles\nSupported Object Types\nComments can be added to the following Langfuse objects:\n- Traces - Comment on complete execution flows\n- Observations - Add notes to specific LLM calls, spans, or events\n- Sessions - Discuss user interaction patterns\n- Prompts - Collaborate on prompt versions and improvements\nAdding Comments\nEach supported object page displays a comment button in the interface. The button shows:\n- The current comment count (capped at \u201c99+\u201d for readability)\n- A disabled state if you don\u2019t have read permissions\n- An active state when comments are available or you can create them\nClicking the comment button opens a side drawer containing:\n- Comment Thread - All existing comments displayed chronologically\n- Composer - Text area for writing new comments (if you have write permissions)\n- Markdown Preview - Real-time preview of your formatted comment\nComment authors can only delete their own comments.

Sensitive LLM Data\nMasking is a feature that allows precise control over the tracing data sent to the Langfuse server. With custom masking functions, you can control and sanitize the data that gets traced and sent to the server. Whether it\u2019s for compliance reasons or to protect user privacy, masking sensitive data is a crucial step in responsible application development. It enables you to:\n- Redact sensitive information from trace or observation inputs and outputs.\n- Customize the content of events before transmission.\n- Implement fine-grained data filtering based on your specific requirements.\nLearn more about Langfuse\u2019s data security and privacy measures concerning the stored data in our security and compliance overview.\nHow it works\n- You define a custom masking function and pass it to the Langfuse client constructor.\n- All event inputs and outputs are processed through this function.\n- The masked data is then sent to the Langfuse server.\nThis approach ensures that you have complete control over the event input and output data traced by your application.\nDefine a masking function. The masking function will apply to all event inputs and outputs regardless of the Langfuse-maintained integration you are using.\ndef masking_function(data: any, **kwargs) -> any:\n\"\"\"Function to mask sensitive data before sending to Langfuse.\"\"\"\nif isinstance(data, str) and data.startswith(\"SECRET_\"):\nreturn \"REDACTED\"\n# For more complex data structures\nelif isinstance(data, dict):\nreturn {k: masking_function(v) for k, v in data.items()}\nelif isinstance(data, list):\nreturn [masking_function(item) for item in data]\nreturn data\nApply the masking function when initializing the Langfuse client:\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\n# Initialize with masking function\nlangfuse = Langfuse(mask=masking_function)\n# Then get the client\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nWith the decorator:\nfrom langfuse import observe\nlangfuse = Langfuse(mask=masking_function)\n@observe()\ndef my_function():\n# This data will be masked before being sent to Langfuse\nreturn \"SECRET_DATA\"\nresult = my_function()\nprint(result) # Original: \"SECRET_DATA\"\n# The trace output in Langfuse will have the output masked as \"REDACTED\"\nUsing context managers:\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nlangfuse = Langfuse(mask=masking_function)\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(\nname=\"sensitive-operation\",\ninput=\"SECRET_INPUT_DATA\"\n) as span:\n# ... processing ...\nspan.update(output=\"SECRET_OUTPUT_DATA\")\n# Both input and output will be masked as \"REDACTED\" in Langfuse\nExamples\nNow, we\u2019ll show you examples how to use the masking feature. We\u2019ll use the Langfuse decorator for this, but you can also use the low-level SDK or the JS/TS SDK analogously.\nExample 1: Redacting Credit Card Numbers\nIn this example, we\u2019ll demonstrate how to redact credit card numbers from strings using a regular expression. This helps in complying with PCI DSS by ensuring that credit card numbers are not transmitted or stored improperly.\nLangfuse\u2019s masking feature allows you to define a custom masking function with parameters, which you then pass to the Langfuse client constructor. This function is applied to all event inputs and outputs, processing each piece of data to mask or redact sensitive information according to your specifications. By ensuring that all events are processed through your masking function before being sent, Langfuse guarantees that only the masked data is transmitted to the Langfuse server.\nSteps:\n- Import necessary modules.\n- Define a masking function that uses a regular expression to detect and replace credit card numbers.\n- Configure the masking function in Langfuse.\n- Create a sample function to simulate processing sensitive data.\n- Observe the trace to see the masked output.\nimport re\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse, observe, get_client\n# Step 2: Define the masking function\ndef masking_function(data, **kwargs):\nif isinstance(data, str):\n# Regular expression to match credit card numbers (Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, etc.)\npattern = r'\\b(?:\\d[ -]*?){13,19}\\b'\ndata = re.sub(pattern, '[REDACTED CREDIT CARD]', data)\nreturn data\n# Step 3: Configure the masking function\nlangfuse = Langfuse(mask=masking_function)\n# Step 4: Create a sample function with sensitive data\n@observe()\ndef process_payment():\n# Simulated sensitive data containing a credit card number\ntransaction_info = \"Customer paid with card number 4111 1111 1111 1111.\"\nreturn transaction_info\n# Step 5: Observe the trace\nresult = process_payment()\nprint(result)\n# Output: Customer paid with card number [REDACTED CREDIT CARD].\n# Flush events in short-lived applications\nlangfuse.flush()\nExample 2: Using the llm-guard\nlibrary\nIn this example, we\u2019ll use the Anonymize\nscanner from llm-guard\nto remove personal names and other PII from the data. This is useful for anonymizing user data and protecting privacy.\nFind our more about the llm-guard\nlibrary in their documentation.\nSteps:\n- Install the\nllm-guard\nlibrary. - Import necessary modules.\n- Initialize the Vault and configure the Anonymize scanner.\n- Define a masking function that uses the Anonymize scanner.\n- Configure the masking function in Langfuse.\n- Create a sample function to simulate processing data with PII.\n- Observe the trace to see the masked output.\npip install llm-guard\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse, observe, get_client\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners.anonymize_helpers import BERT_LARGE_NER_CONF\n# Step 3: Initialize the Vault and configure the Anonymize scanner\nvault = Vault()\ndef create_anonymize_scanner():\nscanner = Anonymize(\nvault,\nrecognizer_conf=BERT_LARGE_NER_CONF,\nlanguage=\"en\"\n)\nreturn scanner\n# Step 4: Define the masking function\ndef masking_function(data, **kwargs):\nif isinstance(data, str):\nscanner = create_anonymize_scanner()\n# Scan and redact the data\nsanitized_data, is_valid, risk_score = scanner.scan(data)\nreturn sanitized_data\nreturn data\n# Step 5: Configure the masking function\nlangfuse = Langfuse(mask=masking_function)\n# Step 6: Create a sample function with PII\n@observe()\ndef generate_report():\n# Simulated data containing personal names\nreport = \"John Doe met with Jane Smith to discuss the project.\"\nreturn report\n# Step 7: Observe the trace\nresult = generate_report()\nprint(result)\n# Output: [REDACTED_PERSON] met with [REDACTED_PERSON] to discuss the project.\n# Flush events in short-lived applications\nlangfuse.flush()\nLink to the trace in Langfuse 2\nExample 3: Masking Email and Phone Numbers\nYou can extend the masking function to redact other types of PII such as email addresses and phone numbers using regular expressions.\nimport re\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse, observe, get_client\ndef masking_function(data, **kwargs):\nif isinstance(data, str):\n# Mask email addresses\ndata = re.sub(r'\\b[\\w.-]+?@\\w+?\\.\\w+?\\b', '[REDACTED EMAIL]', data)\n# Mask phone numbers\ndata = re.sub(r'\\b\\d{3}[-. ]?\\d{3}[-. ]?\\d{4}\\b', '[REDACTED PHONE]', data)\nreturn data\nlangfuse = Langfuse(mask=masking_function)\n@observe()\ndef contact_customer():\ninfo = \"Please contact John at [email protected] or call 555-123-4567.\"\nreturn info\nresult = contact_customer()\nprint(result)\n# Output: Please contact John at [REDACTED EMAIL] or call [REDACTED PHONE].\n# Flush events in short-lived applications\nlangfuse.flush()", "links": [{"href":

"text": "Multi-Modality and Attachments\nSupport for media attachments to traces is currently in beta. Please report any issues and add feature requests to this ongoing discussion thread.\nLangfuse supports multi-modal traces including text, images, audio, and other attachments.\nBy default, base64 encoded data URIs are handled automatically by the Langfuse SDKs. They are extracted from the payloads commonly used in multi-modal LLMs, uploaded to Langfuse\u2019s object storage, and linked to the trace.\nThis also works if you:\n- Reference media files via external URLs.\n- Customize the handling of media files in the SDKs via the\nLangfuseMedia\nclass. - Integrate via the Langfuse API directly.\nLearn more on how to get started and how this works under the hood below.\nExamples\nAvailability\nLangfuse Cloud\nMulti-modal attachments on Langfuse Cloud are free while in beta. We will be rolling out a new pricing metric to account for the additional storage and compute costs associated with large multi-modal traces in the coming weeks.\nSelf-hosting\nMulti-modal attachments are available today. You need to configure your own object storage bucket via the Langfuse environment variables (LANGFUSE_S3_MEDIA_UPLOAD_*\n). See self-hosting documentation for details on these environment variables. S3-compatible APIs are supported across all major cloud providers and can be self-hosted via minio. Note that the configured storage bucket must have a publicly resolvable hostname to support direct uploads via our SDKs and media asset fetching directly from the browser.\nSupported media formats\nLangfuse supports:\n- Images: .png, .jpg, .webp\n- Audio files: .mpeg, .mp3, .wav\n- Other attachments: .pdf, plain text\nIf you require support for additional file types, please let us know in our GitHub Discussion where we\u2019re actively gathering feedback on multi-modal support.\nGet Started\nBase64 data URI encoded media\nIf you use base64 encoded images, audio, or other files in your LLM applications, upgrade to the latest version of the Langfuse SDKs. The Langfuse SDKs automatically detect and handle base64 encoded media by extracting it, uploading it separately as a Langfuse Media file, and including a reference in the trace.\nThis works with standard Data URI (MDN) formatted media (like those used by OpenAI and other LLMs).\nThis notebook includes a couple of examples using the OpenAI SDK and LangChain.\nExternal media (URLs)\nLangfuse supports in-line rendering of media files via URLs if they follow common formats. In this case, the media file is not uploaded to Langfuse\u2019s object storage but simply rendered in the UI directly from the source.\nSupported formats:\n![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)\nCustom attachments\nIf you want to have more control or your media is not base64 encoded, you can upload arbitrary media attachments to Langfuse via the SDKs using the new LangfuseMedia\nclass. Wrap media with LangfuseMedia before including it in trace inputs, outputs, or metadata. See the multi-modal documentation for examples.\nfrom langfuse import get_client, observe\nfrom langfuse.media import LangfuseMedia\n# Create a LangfuseMedia object from a file\nwith open(\"static/bitcoin.pdf\", \"rb\") as pdf_file:\npdf_bytes = pdf_file.read()\n# Wrap media in LangfuseMedia class\npdf_media = LangfuseMedia(content_bytes=pdf_bytes, content_type=\"application/pdf\")\n# Using with the decorator\n@observe()\ndef process_document():\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Update the current trace with the media file\nlangfuse.update_current_trace(\nmetadata={\"document\": pdf_media}\n)\n# Or update the current span\nlangfuse.update_current_span(\ninput={\"document\": pdf_media}\n)\n# Using with context managers\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"analyze-document\") as span: # Include media in the span input, output, or metadata\nspan.update(\ninput={\"document\": pdf_media},\nmetadata={\"file_size\": len(pdf_bytes)}\n)\n# Process document...\n# Add results with media to the output\nspan.update(output={\n\"summary\": \"This document explains Bitcoin...\",\n\"original\": pdf_media\n})\nAPI\nIf you use the API directly to log traces to Langfuse, you need to follow these steps:\nUpload media to Langfuse\n- If you use base64 encoded media: you need to extract it from the trace payloads similar to how the Langfuse SDKs do it.\n- Initialize the upload and get a\nmediaId\nandpresignedURL\n:POST /api/public/media\n. - Upload media file:\nPUT [presignedURL]\n.\nSee this end-to-end example (Python) on how to use the API directly to upload media files.\nAdd reference to mediaId in trace/observation\nUse the Langfuse Media Token to reference the mediaId\nin the trace or observation input\n, output\n, or metadata\n.\nHow does it work?\nWhen using media files (that are not referenced via external URLs), Langfuse handles them in the following way:\n1. Media Upload Process\nDetection and Extraction\n- Langfuse supports media files in traces and observations on\ninput\n,output\n, andmetadata\nfields - SDKs separate media from tracing data client-side for performance optimization\n- Media files are uploaded directly to object storage (AWS S3 or compatible)\n- Original media content is replaced with a reference string\nSecurity and Optimization\n- Uploads use presigned URLs with content validation (content length, content type, content SHA256 hash)\n- Deduplication: Files are simply replaced by their\nmediaId\nreference string if already uploaded - File uniqueness determined by project, content type, and content SHA256 hash\nImplementation Details\n- Python SDK: Background thread handling for non-blocking execution\n- JS/TS SDKs: Asynchronous, non-blocking implementation\n- API support for direct uploads (see guide)\n2. Media Reference System\nThe base64 data URIs and the wrapped LangfuseMedia\nobjects in Langfuse traces are replaced by references to the mediaId\nin the following standardized token format, which helps reconstruct the original payload if needed:\n@@@langfuseMedia:type={MIME_TYPE}|id={LANGFUSE_MEDIA_ID}|source={SOURCE_TYPE}@@@\nMIME_TYPE\n: MIME type of the media file, e.g.,image/jpeg\nLANGFUSE_MEDIA_ID\n: ID of the media file in Langfuse\u2019s object storageSOURCE_TYPE\n: Source type of the media file, can bebase64_data_uri\n,bytes\n, orfile\nBased on this token, the Langfuse UI can automatically detect the mediaId\nand render the media file inline. The LangfuseMedia\nclass provides utility functions to extract the mediaId\nfrom the reference string.\n3. Resolving Media References\nWhen dealing with traces, observations, or dataset items that include media references, you can convert them back to their base64 data URI format using the resolve_media_references\nutility method provided by the Langfuse client. This is particularly useful for reinserting the original content during fine-tuning, dataset runs, or replaying a generation. The utility method traverses the parsed object and returns a deep copy with all media reference strings replaced by the corresponding base64 data URI representations.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\n# Initialize Langfuse client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Example object with media references\nobj = {\n\"image\": \"@@@langfuseMedia:type=image/jpeg|id=some-uuid|source=bytes@@@\",\n\"nested\": {\n\"pdf\": \"@@@langfuseMedia:type=application/pdf|id=some-other-uuid|source=bytes@@@\"\n}\n}\n# Resolve media references to base64 data URIs\nresolved_obj = langfuse.resolve_media_references(\nobj=obj,\nresolve_with=\"base64_data_uri\"\n)\n# Result:\n# {\n# \"image\": \"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...\",\n# \"nested\": {\n# \"pdf\": \"data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjcK...\"\n# }\n# }", "links": [{"href":

"Observation Types\nLangfuse supports different observation types to provide more context to your spans and allow efficient filtering.\nAvailable Types\n-\nevent\nis the basic building block. An event is used to track discrete events in a trace. -\nspan\nrepresents durations of units of work in a trace. -\ngeneration\nlogs generations of AI models incl. prompts, token usage and costs. -\nagent\ndecides on the application flow and can for example use tools with the guidance of a LLM. -\ntool\nrepresents a tool call, for example to a weather API. -\nchain\nis a link between different application steps, like passing context from a retriever to a LLM call. -\nretriever\nrepresents data retrieval steps, such as a call to a vector store or a database. -\nevaluator\nrepresents functions that assess relevance/correctness/helpfulness of a LLM\u2019s outputs. -\nembedding\nis a call to a LLM to generate embeddings and can include model, token usage and costs -\nguardrail\nis a component that protects against malicious content or jailbreaks.\nHow to Use Observation Types\nThe integrations with agent frameworks automatically set the observation types. For example, marking a method with @tool\nin langchain will automatically set the Langfuse observation type to tool\n.\nYou can also manually set the observation types for your application within the Langfuse SDK. Set the as_type\nparameter (Python) or asType\nparameter (TypeScript) to the desired observation type when creating an observation.\nObservation types require Python SDK version>=3.3.1\n.\nUsing @observe\ndecorator:\nfrom langfuse import observe\n# Agent workflow\n@observe(as_type=\"agent\")\ndef run_agent_workflow(query):\n# Agent reasoning and tool orchestration\nreturn process_with_tools(query)\n# Tool calls\n@observe(as_type=\"tool\")\ndef call_weather_api(location):\n# External API call\nreturn weather_service.get_weather(location)\nCalling the start_as_current_observation\nor start_observation\nmethod:\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Start observation with specific type\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_observation(\nas_type=\"embedding\",\nname=\"embedding-generation\"\n) as obs:\nembeddings = model.encode([\"text to embed\"])\nobs.update(output=embeddings)\n# Start observation with specific type\ntransform_span = langfuse.start_observation(\nas_type=\"chain\",\nname=\"transform-text\"\n)\ntransformed_text = transform_text([\"text to

"Event Queuing/Batching\nLangfuse\u2019s client SDKs and integrations are all designed to queue and batch requests in the background to optimize API calls and network time. Batches are determined by a combination of time and size (number of events and size of batch).\nConfiguration\nAll integrations have a sensible default configuration, but you can customize the batching behaviour to suit your needs.\nYou can e.g. set flushAt=1\nto send every event immediately, or flushInterval=1000\nto send every second.\nManual flushing\nIn short-lived environments like serverless functions (e.g., Vercel Functions, AWS Lambda), you should explicitly flush the traces before the process exits or the runtime environment is frozen. If you do not flush the client, you may lose events.\nIf you want to send a batch immediately, you can call the flush\nmethod on the client. In case of network issues, flush will log an error and retry the batch, it will never throw an exception.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\n# access the client directly\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Flush all pending observations\nlangfuse.flush()\nIf you exit the application, use shutdown\nmethod to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits. On success of this function, no more events will be sent to Langfuse API.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nlangfuse.shutdown()", "links": [{"href":

"Sampling\nSampling can be used to control the volume of traces collected by Langfuse. Sampling is handled client-side.\nYou can configure the sample rate by setting the LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE\nenvironment variable or by using the sample_rate\n/sampleRate\nconstructor parameter. The value has to be between 0 and 1.\nThe default value is 1, meaning that all traces are collected. A value of 0.2 means that only 20% of the traces are collected. The SDK samples on the trace level meaning that if a trace is sampled, all observations and scores within that trace will be sampled as well.\nWith the Python SDK, you can configure sampling when initializing the client:\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse, get_client\nimport os\n# Method 1: Set environment variable\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE\"] = \"0.5\" # As string in env var\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Method 2: Initialize with constructor parameter then get client\nLangfuse(sample_rate=0.5) # 50% of traces will be sampled\nlangfuse = get_client()\nWhen using the @observe()\ndecorator:\nfrom langfuse import observe, Langfuse, get_client\n# Initialize the client with sampling\nLangfuse(sample_rate=0.3) # 30% of traces will be sampled\n@observe()\ndef process_data():\n# Only ~30% of calls to this function will generate traces\n# The decision is made at the trace level (first span)\npass\nIf a trace is not sampled, none of its observations (spans or generations) or associated scores will be sent to Langfuse, which can significantly reduce data volume for high-traffic applications.", "links": [{"href":

for LLM applications (open source) - Langfuse", "text": "Model Usage & Cost Tracking\nLangfuse tracks the usage and costs of your LLM generations and provides breakdowns by usage types.\n- Usage details: number of units consumed per usage type\n- Cost details: USD cost per usage type\nUsage types can be arbitrary strings and differ by LLM provider. At the highest level, they can be simply input\nand output\n. As LLMs grow more sophisticated, additional usage types are necessary, such as cached_tokens\n, audio_tokens\n, image_tokens\n.\nIn the UI, Langfuse summarizes all usage types that include the string input\nas input usage types, similarlyoutput\nas output usage types. If no total\nusage type is ingested, Langfuse sums up all usage type units to a total.\nBoth usage details and cost details can be either\n- ingested via API, SDKs or integrations\n- or inferred based on the\nmodel\nparameter of the generation. Langfuse comes with a list of predefined popular models and their tokenizers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models. You can also add your own custom model definitions or request official support for new models via GitHub. Inferred cost are calculated at the time of ingestion with the model and price information available at that point in time.\nIngested usage and cost are prioritized over inferred usage and cost:\nVia the Daily Metrics API, you can retrieve aggregated daily usage and cost metrics from Langfuse for downstream use in analytics, billing, and rate-limiting. The API allows you to filter by application type, user, or tags.\nIngest usage and/or cost\nIf available in the LLM response, ingesting usage and/or cost is the most accurate and robust way to track usage in Langfuse.\nMany of the Langfuse integrations automatically capture usage details and cost details data from the LLM response. If this does not work as expected, please create an issue on GitHub.\nWhen using the @observe()\ndecorator:\nfrom langfuse import observe, get_client\nimport anthropic\nlangfuse = get_client()\nanthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic()\n@observe(as_type=\"generation\")\ndef anthropic_completion(**kwargs):\n# optional, extract some fields from kwargs\nkwargs_clone = kwargs.copy()\ninput = kwargs_clone.pop('messages', None)\nmodel = kwargs_clone.pop('model', None)\nlangfuse.update_current_generation(\ninput=input,\nmodel=model,\nmetadata=kwargs_clone\n)\nresponse = anthropic_client.messages.create(**kwargs)\nlangfuse.update_current_generation(\nusage_details={\n\"input\": response.usage.input_tokens,\n\"output\": response.usage.output_tokens,\n\"cache_read_input_tokens\": response.usage.cache_read_input_tokens\n# \"total\": int, # if not set, it is derived from input + cache_read_input_tokens + output\n},\n# Optionally, also ingest usd cost.

The keys nested in prompt_tokens_details\nwill be flattened with an input_\nprefix and completion_tokens_details\nwill be flattened with an output_\nprefix.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\nname=\"openai-style-generation\",\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\"\n) as generation:\n# Simulate LLM call\n# response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)\ngeneration.update(\nusage_details={\n# usage (OpenAI-style schema)\n\"prompt_tokens\": 10,\n\"completion_tokens\": 25,\n\"total_tokens\": 35,\n\"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n\"cached_tokens\": 5,\n\"audio_tokens\": 2,\n},\n\"completion_tokens_details\": {\n\"reasoning_tokens\": 15,\n},\n}\n)\nYou can also ingest OpenAI-style usage via generation.update()\nand generation.end()\n.\nInfer usage and/or cost\nIf either usage or cost are not ingested, Langfuse will attempt to infer the missing values based on the model\nparameter of the generation at the time of ingestion. This is especially useful for some model providers or self-hosted models which do not include usage or cost in the response.\nLangfuse comes with a list of predefined popular models and their tokenizers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google. Check out the full list (you need to sign-in).\nYou can also add your own custom model definitions (see below) or request official support for new models via GitHub.\nUsage\nIf a tokenizer is specified for the model, Langfuse automatically calculates token amounts for ingested generations.\nThe following tokenizers are currently supported:\nCost\nModel definitions include prices per usage type. Usage types must match exactly with the keys in the usage_details\nobject of the generation.\nLangfuse automatically calculates cost for ingested generations at the time of ingestion if (1) usage is ingested or inferred, (2) and a matching model definition includes prices.\nCustom model definitions\nYou can flexibly add your own model definitions to Langfuse. This is especially useful for self-hosted or fine-tuned models which are not included in the list of Langfuse maintained models.\nModels are matched to generations based on:\nUser-defined models take priority over models maintained by Langfuse.\nFurther details\nWhen using the openai\ntokenizer, you need to specify the following tokenization config. You can also copy the config from the list of predefined OpenAI models. See the OpenAI documentation for further details. tokensPerName\nand tokensPerMessage\nare required for chat models.\n{\n\"tokenizerModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", // tiktoken model name\n\"tokensPerName\": -1, // OpenAI Chatmessage tokenization config\n\"tokensPerMessage\": 4 // OpenAI Chatmessage tokenization config\n}\nCost inference for reasoning models\nCost inference by tokenizing the LLM input and output is not supported for reasoning models such as the OpenAI o1 model family. That is, if no token counts are ingested, Langfuse can not infer cost for reasoning models.\nReasoning models take multiple steps to arrive to a response. The result from each step generates reasoning tokens that are billed as output tokens. So the cost-effective output token count is the sum of all reasoning tokens and the token count for the final completion. Since Langfuse does not have visibility into the reasoning tokens, it cannot infer the correct cost for generations that have no token usage provided.\nTo benefit from Langfuse cost tracking, please provide the token usage when ingesting o1 model generations. When utilizing the Langfuse OpenAI wrapper or integrations such as for Langchain, LlamaIndex or LiteLLM, token usage is collected and provided automatically for you.\nFor more details, see the OpenAI guide on how reasoning models work.\nTroubleshooting\n- If you change the model definition, the updated costs will only be applied to new generations logged to Langfuse.", "links": [{"href":

For new use cases, please use the Metrics API instead. It has higher rate-limits and offers more flexibility.\nGET /api/public/metrics/daily\nVia the Daily Metrics API, you can retrieve aggregated daily usage and cost metrics from Langfuse for downstream use, e.g., in analytics, billing, and rate-limiting. The API allows you to filter by application type, user, or tags for tailored data retrieval.\nSee API reference for more details.\nOverview\nReturned data includes daily timeseries of:\n- Cost in USD\n- Trace and observation count\n- Break down by model name\n- Usage (e.g. tokens) broken down by input and output usage\n- Cost in USD\n- Trace and observation count\nOptional filters:\ntraceName\nto commonly filter by the application type, depending on how you usename\nin your tracesuserId\nto filter by usertags\nto filter by tagsfromTimestamp\ntoTimestamp\nMissing a key metric or filter?

Langfuse", "text": "Overview\nIf you are self-hosting Langfuse, the Python SDK v3 requires Langfuse platform version >= 3.63.0 for traces to be correctly processed.\nDocumentation for the legacy Python SDK v2 can be found here.\nOur OpenTelemetry-based Python SDK (v3) is the latest generation of the SDK designed for a improved developer experience and enhanced ease of use. Built on the OpenTelemetry Python SDK, it offers a more intuitive API for comprehensive tracing of your LLM application.\nKey benefits:\n- Improved Developer Experience: A more intuitive API means less code to write for tracing your application, simplifying the integration process.\n- Unified Context Sharing: Seamlessly hook into the tracing context of the current span to update it or create child spans. This is particularly beneficial for integrating with other instrumented libraries.\n- Broad Third-Party Integrations: Any library instrumented with OpenTelemetry will work out-of-the-box with the Langfuse SDK. Spans from these libraries are automatically captured and correctly nested within your Langfuse traces.\nQuickstart\nThere are three main ways of instrumenting your application with the new Langfuse SDK. All of them are fully interoperable with each other.\nThe @observe\ndecorator is the simplest way to instrument your application. It is a function decorator that can be applied to any function.\nIt sets the current span in the context for automatic nesting of child spans and automatically ends it when the function returns. It also automatically captures the function name, arguments, and return value.\nfrom langfuse import observe, get_client\n@observe\ndef my_function():\nreturn \"Hello, world!\" # Input/output and timings are automatically captured\nmy_function()\n# Flush events in short-lived applications\nlangfuse = get_client()\nlangfuse.flush()\nLearn more\nOTel and Langfuse\nThe Python SDK v3 is built upon OpenTelemetry (OTel), a standard for observability. Understanding the relation between OTel and Langfuse is not required to use the SDK, but it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the concepts. OTel related concepts are abstracted away and you can use the SDK without being deeply familiar with them.\n- OTel Trace: An OTel-trace represents the entire lifecycle of a request or transaction as it moves through your application and its services. A trace is typically a sequence of operations, like an LLM generating a response followed by a parsing step. The root (first) span created in a sequence defines the OTel trace. OTel traces do not have a start and end time, they are defined by the root span.\n- OTel Span: A span represents a single unit of work or operation within a trace. Spans have a start and end time, a name, and can have attributes (key-value pairs of metadata). Spans can be nested to create a hierarchy, showing parent-child relationships between operations.\n- Langfuse Trace: A Langfuse trace collects observations and holds trace attributes such as\nsession_id\n,user_id\nas well as overall input and outputs. It shares the same ID as the OTel trace and its attributes are set via specific OTel span attributes that are automatically propagated to the Langfuse trace. - Langfuse Observation: In Langfuse terminology, an \u201cobservation\u201d is a Langfuse-specific representation of an OTel span. It can be a generic span (Langfuse-span) or a specialized \u201cgeneration\u201d (Langfuse-generation) or a point in time event (Langfuse-event).\n- Langfuse Span: A Langfuse-span is a generic OTel span in Langfuse, designed for non-LLM operations.\n- Langfuse Generation: A Langfuse-generation is a specialized type of OTel span in Langfuse, designed specifically for Large Language Model (LLM) calls. It includes additional fields like\nmodel\n,model_parameters\n,usage_details\n(tokens), andcost_details\n. - Langfuse Event: A Langfuse-event tracks a point in time action.\n- Context Propagation: OpenTelemetry automatically handles the propagation of the current trace and span context. This means when you call another function (whether it\u2019s also traced by Langfuse, an OTel-instrumented library, or a manually created span), the new span will automatically become a child of the currently active span, forming a correct trace hierarchy.\nThe Langfuse SDK provides wrappers around OTel spans (LangfuseSpan\n, LangfuseGeneration\n) that offer convenient methods for interacting with Langfuse-specific features like scoring and media handling, while still being native OTel spans under the hood. You can also use these wrapper objects to add Langfuse trace attributes.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192

"https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/sdk/python/instrumentation": {"url": "https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/sdk/python/instrumentation", "title": "Instrument your application with the Langfuse Python SDK - Langfuse", "text": "Instrumentation\nTo instrument your application to send traces to Langfuse, you can use either native library instrumentations that work out of the box, or use custom instrumentation methods for fine-grained control.\nCustom Instrumentation\nThere are three main ways to create spans with the Langfuse Python SDK. All of them are fully interoperable with each other.\nThe @observe()\ndecorator provides a convenient way to automatically trace function executions, including capturing their inputs, outputs, execution time, and any errors. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous functions.\nfrom langfuse import observe\n@observe()\ndef my_data_processing_function(data, parameter):\n# ... processing logic ...\nreturn {\"processed_data\": data, \"status\": \"ok\"}\n@observe(name=\"llm-call\", as_type=\"generation\")\nasync def my_async_llm_call(prompt_text):\n# ... async LLM call ...\nreturn \"LLM response\"\nParameters:\nname: Optional[str]\n: Custom name for the created span/generation. Defaults to the function name.as_type: Optional[Literal[\"generation\"]]\n: If set to\"generation\"\n, a Langfuse generation object is created, suitable for LLM calls. Otherwise, a regular span is created.capture_input: bool\n: Whether to capture function arguments as input. Defaults to env varLANGFUSE_OBSERVE_DECORATOR_IO_CAPTURE_ENABLED\norTrue\nif not set.capture_output: bool\n: Whether to capture function return value as output. Defaults to env varLANGFUSE_OBSERVE_DECORATOR_IO_CAPTURE_ENABLED\norTrue\nif not set.transform_to_string: Optional[Callable[[Iterable], str]]\n: For functions that return generators (sync or async), this callable can be provided to transform the collected chunks into a single string for theoutput\nfield. If not provided, and all chunks are strings, they will be concatenated. Otherwise, the list of chunks is stored.\nTrace Context and Special Keyword Arguments:\nThe @observe\ndecorator automatically propagates the OTEL trace context. If a decorated function is called from within an active Langfuse span (or another OTEL span), the new observation will be nested correctly.\nYou can also pass special keyword arguments to a decorated function to control its tracing behavior:\nlangfuse_trace_id: str\n: Explicitly set the trace ID for this function call. Must be a valid W3C Trace Context trace ID (32-char hex). If you have a trace ID from an external system, you can useLangfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_trace_id)\nto generate a valid deterministic ID.langfuse_parent_observation_id: str\n: Explicitly set the parent observation ID. Must be a valid W3C Trace Context span ID (16-char hex).\n@observe()\ndef my_function(a, b):\nreturn a + b\n# Call with a specific trace context\nmy_function(1, 2, langfuse_trace_id=\"1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef\")\nThe observe decorator is capturing the args, kwargs and return value of decorated functions by default. This may lead to performance issues in your application if you have large or deeply nested objects there. To avoid this, explicitly disable function IO capture on the decorated function by passing capture_input / capture_output\nwith value False\nor globally by setting the environment variable LANGFUSE_OBSERVE_DECORATOR_IO_CAPTURE_ENABLED=False\n.\nNesting Observations\nThe function call hierarchy is automatically captured by the @observe\ndecorator reflected in the trace.\nfrom langfuse import observe\n@observe\ndef my_data_processing_function(data, parameter):\n# ... processing logic ...\nreturn {\"processed_data\": data, \"status\": \"ok\"}\n@observe\ndef main_function(data, parameter):\nreturn my_data_processing_function(data, parameter)\nUpdating Observations\nYou can update observations with new information as your code executes.\n- For spans/generations created via context managers or assigned to variables: use the\n.update()\nmethod on the object. - To update the currently active observation in the context (without needing a direct reference to it): use\nlangfuse.update_current_span()\norlangfuse.update_current_generation()\n.\nLangfuseSpan.update()\n/ LangfuseGeneration.update()\nparameters:\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_generation(name=\"llm-call\", model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\") as gen:\ngen.update(input={\"prompt\": \"Why is the sky blue?\"})\n# ... make LLM call ...\nresponse_text = \"Rayleigh scattering...\"\ngen.update(\noutput=response_text,\nusage_details={\"input_tokens\": 5, \"output_tokens\": 50},\nmetadata={\"confidence\": 0.9}\n)\n# Alternatively, update the current observation in context:\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"data-processing\"):\n# ... some processing ...\nlangfuse.update_current_span(metadata={\"step1_complete\": True})\n# ... more processing ...\nlangfuse.update_current_span(output={\"result\": \"final_data\"})\nSetting Trace Attributes\nTrace-level attributes apply to the entire trace, not just a single observation. You can set or update these using:\n- The\n.update_trace()\nmethod on anyLangfuseSpan\norLangfuseGeneration\nobject within that trace. langfuse.update_current_trace()\nto update the trace associated with the currently active observation.\nTrace attribute parameters:\nExample: Setting Multiple Trace Attributes\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"initial-operation\") as span:\n# Set trace attributes early\nspan.update_trace(\nuser_id=\"user_xyz\",\nsession_id=\"session_789\",\ntags=[\"beta-feature\", \"llm-chain\"]\n)\n# ...\n# Later, from another span in the same trace:\nwith span.start_as_current_generation(name=\"final-generation\") as gen:\n# ...\nlangfuse.update_current_trace(output={\"final_status\": \"success\"}, public=True)\nTrace Input/Output Behavior\nIn v3, trace input and output are automatically set from the root observation (first span/generation) by default. This differs from v2 where integrations could set trace-level inputs/outputs directly.\nDefault Behavior\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(\nname=\"user-request\",\ninput={\"query\": \"What is the capital of France?\"} # This becomes the trace input\n) as root_span:\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\nname=\"llm-call\",\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\ninput={\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the capital of France?\"}]}\n) as gen:\nresponse = \"Paris is the capital of France.\"\ngen.update(output=response)\n# LLM generation input/output are separate from trace input/output\nroot_span.update(output={\"answer\": \"Paris\"}) # This becomes the trace output\nOverride Default Behavior\nIf you need different trace inputs/outputs than the root observation, explicitly set them:\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"complex-pipeline\") as root_span:\n# Root span has its own input/output\nroot_span.update(input=\"Step 1 data\", output=\"Step 1 result\")\n# But trace should have different input/output (e.g., for LLM-as-a-judge)\nroot_span.update_trace(\ninput={\"original_query\": \"User's actual question\"},\noutput={\"final_answer\": \"Complete response\", \"confidence\": 0.95}\n)\n# Now trace input/output are independent of root span input/output\nCritical for LLM-as-a-Judge Features\nLLM-as-a-judge and evaluation features typically rely on trace-level inputs and outputs. Make sure to set these appropriately:\nfrom langfuse import observe, get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n@observe()\ndef process_user_query(user_question: str):\n# LLM processing...\nanswer = call_llm(user_question)\n# Explicitly set trace input/output for evaluation features\nlangfuse.update_current_trace(\ninput={\"question\": user_question},\noutput={\"answer\": answer}\n)\nreturn answer\nTrace and Observation IDs\nLangfuse uses W3C Trace Context compliant IDs:\n- Trace IDs: 32-character lowercase hexadecimal string (16 bytes).\n- Observation IDs (Span IDs): 16-character lowercase hexadecimal string (8 bytes).\nYou can retrieve these IDs:\nlangfuse.get_current_trace_id()\n: Gets the trace ID of the currently active observation.langfuse.get_current_observation_id()\n: Gets the ID of the currently active observation.span_obj.trace_id\nandspan_obj.id\n: Access IDs directly from aLangfuseSpan\norLangfuseGeneration\nobject.\nFor scenarios where you need to generate IDs outside of an active trace (e.g., to link scores to traces/observations that will be created later, or to correlate with external systems), use:\nLangfuse.create_trace_id(seed: Optional[str] = None)\n(static method): Generates a new trace ID. If aseed\nis provided, the ID is deterministic. Use the same seed to get the same ID. This is useful for correlating external IDs with Langfuse traces.\nfrom langfuse import get_client, Langfuse\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Get current IDs\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"my-op\") as current_op:\ntrace_id = langfuse.get_current_trace_id()\nobservation_id = langfuse.get_current_observation_id()\nprint(f\"Current Trace ID: {trace_id}, Current Observation ID: {observation_id}\")\nprint(f\"From object: Trace ID: {current_op.trace_id}, Observation ID: {current_op.id}\")\n# Generate IDs deterministically\nexternal_request_id = \"req_12345\"\ndeterministic_trace_id = Langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_request_id)\nprint(f\"Deterministic Trace ID for {external_request_id}: {deterministic_trace_id}\")\nLinking to Existing Traces (Trace Context)\nIf you have a trace_id\n(and optionally a parent_span_id\n) from an external source (e.g., another service, a batch job), you can link new observations to it using the trace_context\nparameter. Note that OpenTelemetry offers native cross-service context propagation, so this is not necessarily required for calls between services that are instrumented with OTEL.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nexisting_trace_id = \"abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890\" # From an upstream service\nexisting_parent_span_id = \"fedcba0987654321\" # Optional parent span in that trace\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(\nname=\"process-downstream-task\",\ntrace_context={\n\"trace_id\": existing_trace_id,\n\"parent_span_id\": existing_parent_span_id # If None, this becomes a root span in the existing trace\n}\n) as span:\n# This span is now part of the trace `existing_trace_id`\n# and a child of `existing_parent_span_id` if provided.\nprint(f\"This span's trace_id: {span.trace_id}\") # Will be existing_trace_id\npass\nClient Management\nflush()\nManually triggers the sending of all buffered observations (spans, generations, scores, media metadata) to the Langfuse API. This is useful in short-lived scripts or before exiting an application to ensure all data is persisted.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# ... create traces and observations ...\nlangfuse.flush() # Ensures all pending data is sent\nThe flush()\nmethod blocks until the queued data is processed by the respective background threads.\nshutdown()\nGracefully shuts down the Langfuse client. This includes:\n- Flushing all buffered data (similar to\nflush()\n). - Waiting for background threads (for data ingestion and media uploads) to finish their current tasks and terminate.\nIt\u2019s crucial to call shutdown()\nbefore your application exits to prevent data loss and ensure clean resource release. The SDK automatically registers an atexit\nhook to call shutdown()\non normal program termination, but manual invocation is recommended in scenarios like:\n- Long-running daemons or services when they receive a shutdown signal.\n- Applications where\natexit\nmight not reliably trigger (e.g., certain serverless environments or forceful terminations).\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# ... application logic ...\n# Before exiting:\nlangfuse.shutdown()\nNative Instrumentations\nThe Langfuse Python SDK has native integrations for the OpenAI and LangChain SDK. You can also use any other OTel-based instrumentation library to automatically trace your calls in Langfuse.\nOpenAI Integration\nLangfuse offers a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI Python SDK to automatically trace all your OpenAI API calls. Simply change your import statement:\n- import openai\n+ from langfuse.openai import openai\n# Your existing OpenAI code continues to work as is\n# For example:\n# client = openai.OpenAI()\n# completion = client.chat.completions.create(...)\nWhat\u2019s automatically captured:\n- Requests & Responses: All prompts/completions, including support for streaming, async operations, and function/tool calls.\n- Timings: Latencies for API calls.\n- Errors: API errors are captured with their details.\n- Model Usage: Token counts (input, output, total).\n- Cost: Estimated cost in USD (based on model and token usage).\n- Media: Input audio and output audio from speech-to-text and text-to-speech endpoints.\nThe integration is fully interoperable with @observe\nand manual tracing methods (start_as_current_span\n, etc.). If an OpenAI call is made within an active Langfuse span, the OpenAI generation will be correctly nested under it.\nPassing Langfuse arguments to OpenAI calls:\nYou can pass Langfuse-specific arguments directly to OpenAI client methods. These will be used to enrich the trace data.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nlangfuse = get_client()\nclient = openai.OpenAI()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"qna-bot-openai\") as span:\nlangfuse.update_current_trace(tags=[\"qna-bot-openai\"])\n# This will be traced as a Langfuse generation\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\nname=\"qna-bot-openai\", # Custom name for this generation in Langfuse\nmetadata={\"user_tier\": \"premium\", \"request_source\": \"web_api\"}, # will be added to the Langfuse generation\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is OpenTelemetry?\"}],\n)\nSetting trace attributes via metadata:\nYou can set trace attributes (session_id\n, user_id\n, tags\n) directly on OpenAI calls using special fields in the metadata\nparameter:\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nclient = openai.OpenAI()\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}],\nmetadata={\n\"langfuse_session_id\": \"session_123\",\n\"langfuse_user_id\": \"user_456\",\n\"langfuse_tags\": [\"production\", \"chat-bot\"],\n\"custom_field\": \"additional metadata\" # Regular metadata fields work too\n}\n)\nThe special metadata fields are:\nlangfuse_session_id\n: Sets the session ID for the tracelangfuse_user_id\n: Sets the user ID for the tracelangfuse_tags\n: Sets tags for the trace (should be a list of strings)\nSupported Langfuse arguments: name\n, metadata\n, langfuse_prompt\nLearn more in the OpenAI integration documentation.\nLangchain Integration\nLangfuse provides a callback handler for Langchain to trace its operations.\nSetup:\nInitialize the CallbackHandler\nand add it to your Langchain calls, either globally or per-call.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Example LLM\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Initialize the Langfuse handler\nlangfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()\n# Example: Using it with an LLM call\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o\")\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\nchain = prompt | llm\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"joke-chain\") as span:\nlangfuse.update_current_trace(tags=[\"joke-chain\"])\nresponse = chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"}, config={\"callbacks\": [langfuse_handler]})\nprint(response)\nSetting trace attributes via metadata:\nYou can set trace attributes (session_id\n, user_id\n, tags\n) directly during chain invocation using special fields in the metadata\nconfiguration:\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n# Initialize the Langfuse handler\nlangfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()\n# Create your LangChain components\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o\")\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\nchain = prompt | llm\n# Set trace attributes via metadata in chain invocation\nresponse = chain.invoke(\n{\"topic\": \"cats\"},\nconfig={\n\"callbacks\": [langfuse_handler],\n\"metadata\": {\n\"langfuse_session_id\": \"session_123\",\n\"langfuse_user_id\": \"user_456\",\n\"langfuse_tags\": [\"production\", \"humor-bot\"],\n\"custom_field\": \"additional metadata\" # Regular metadata fields work too\n}\n}\n)\nThe special metadata fields are:\nlangfuse_session_id\n: Sets the session ID for the tracelangfuse_user_id\n: Sets the user ID for the tracelangfuse_tags\n: Sets tags for the trace (should be a list of strings)\nYou can also pass update_trace=True\nto the CallbackHandler init to force a trace update with the chains input, output and metadata.\nWhat\u2019s captured:\nThe callback handler maps various Langchain events to Langfuse observations:\n- Chains (\non_chain_start\n,on_chain_end\n,on_chain_error\n): Traced as spans. - LLMs (\non_llm_start\n,on_llm_end\n,on_llm_error\n,on_chat_model_start\n): Traced as generations, capturing model name, prompts, responses, and usage if available from the LLM provider. - Tools (\non_tool_start\n,on_tool_end\n,on_tool_error\n): Traced as spans, capturing tool input and output. - Retrievers (\non_retriever_start\n,on_retriever_end\n,on_retriever_error\n): Traced as spans, capturing the query and retrieved documents. - Agents (\non_agent_action\n,on_agent_finish\n): Agent actions and final finishes are captured within their parent chain/agent span.\nLangfuse attempts to parse model names, usage, and other relevant details from the information provided by Langchain. The metadata\nargument in Langchain calls can be used to pass additional information to Langfuse, including langfuse_prompt\nto link with managed prompts.\nLearn more in the Langchain integration documentation.\nThird-party integrations\nThe Langfuse SDK seamlessly integrates with any third-party library that uses OpenTelemetry instrumentation. When these libraries emit spans, they are automatically captured and properly nested within your trace hierarchy. This enables unified tracing across your entire application stack without requiring any additional configuration.\nFor example, if you\u2019re using OpenTelemetry-instrumented databases, HTTP clients, or other services alongside your LLM operations, all these spans will be correctly organized within your traces in Langfuse.\nYou can use any third-party, OTEL-based instrumentation library for Anthropic to automatically trace all your Anthropic API calls in Langfuse.\nIn this example, we are using the opentelemetry-instrumentation-anthropic\nlibrary.\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\nfrom opentelemetry.instrumentation.anthropic import AnthropicInstrumentor\nfrom langfuse import get_client\n# This will automatically emit OTEL-spans for all Anthropic API calls\nAnthropicInstrumentor().instrument()\nlangfuse = get_client()\nanthropic_client = Anthropic()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"myspan\"):\n# This will be traced as a Langfuse generation nested under the current span\nmessage = anthropic_client.messages.create(\nmodel=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\",\nmax_tokens=1024,\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}],\n)\nprint(message.content)\n# Flush events to Langfuse in short-lived applications\nlangfuse.flush()\nLearn more in the Anthropic integration documentation.", "links": [{"href":

Langfuse Python SDK - Langfuse", "text": "Evaluations\nThe Python SDK provides ways to evaluate your application. You can add custom scores to your traces and observations, or use the SDK to execute Dataset Runs.\nThis page shows the evaluation methods that are supported by the Python SDK. Please refer to the Evaluation documentation for more information on how to evaluate your application in Langfuse.\nCreate Scores\nspan_or_generation_obj.score()\n: Scores the specific observation object.span_or_generation_obj.score_trace()\n: Scores the entire trace to which the object belongs.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_generation(name=\"summary_generation\") as gen:\n# ... LLM call ...\ngen.update(output=\"summary text...\")\n# Score this specific generation\ngen.score(name=\"conciseness\", value=0.8, data_type=\"NUMERIC\")\n# Score the overall trace\ngen.score_trace(name=\"user_feedback_rating\", value=\"positive\", data_type=\"CATEGORICAL\")\nScore Parameters:\nSee Scoring for more details.\nDataset Runs\nLangfuse Datasets are essential for evaluating and testing your LLM applications by allowing you to manage collections of inputs and their expected outputs.\nCreate a Dataset\n- Creating: You can programmatically create new datasets with\nlangfuse.create_dataset(...)\nand add items to them usinglangfuse.create_dataset_item(...)\n. - Fetching: Retrieve a dataset and its items using\nlangfuse.get_dataset(name: str)\n. This returns aDatasetClient\ninstance, which contains a list ofDatasetItemClient\nobjects (accessible viadataset.items\n). EachDatasetItemClient\nholds theinput\n,expected_output\n, andmetadata\nfor an individual data point.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Fetch an existing dataset\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=\"my-eval-dataset\")\nfor item in dataset.items:\nprint(f\"Input: {item.input}, Expected: {item.expected_output}\")\n# Briefly: Creating a dataset and an item\nnew_dataset = langfuse.create_dataset(name=\"new-summarization-tasks\")\nlangfuse.create_dataset_item(\ndataset_name=\"new-summarization-tasks\",\ninput={\"text\": \"Long article...\"},\nexpected_output={\"summary\": \"Short summary.\"}\n)\nExecute a Dataset Run\nAfter fetching your dataset, you can execute a run against it. This will create a new trace for each item in the dataset. Please refer to the Remote Dataset Run documentation for more details.\nThe most powerful way to use datasets is by linking your application\u2019s executions (traces) to specific dataset items when performing an evaluation run. The DatasetItemClient.run()\nmethod provides a context manager to streamline this process.\nHow item.run()\nworks:\nWhen you use with item.run(run_name=\"your_eval_run_name\") as root_span:\n:\n- Trace Creation: A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.\n- Trace Naming & Metadata:\n- The trace is automatically named (e.g., \u201cDataset run: your_eval_run_name\u201d).\n- Essential metadata is added to this trace, including\ndataset_item_id\n(the ID ofitem\n),run_name\n, anddataset_id\n.\n- DatasetRunItem Linking: The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a\nDatasetRunItem\n. This backend object formally links:- The\ndataset_item_id\n- The\ntrace_id\nof the newly created trace - The provided\nrun_name\n- Any\nrun_metadata\norrun_description\nyou pass toitem.run()\n. This linkage is what populates the \u201cRuns\u201d tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.\n- The\n- Contextual Span: The context manager yields\nroot_span\n, which is aLangfuseSpan\nobject representing the root span of this new trace. - Automatic Nesting: Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created inside the\nwith\nblock will automatically become children ofroot_span\nand thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.\nExample:\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\ndataset_name = \"qna-eval\"\ncurrent_run_name = \"qna_model_v3_run_05_20\" # Identifies this specific evaluation run\n# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function\ndef my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\nname=\"qna-llm-call\",\ninput={\"question\": question, \"context\": context},\nmetadata={\"item_id\": item_id, \"run\": run_name}, # Example metadata for the generation\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\"\n) as generation:\n# Simulate LLM call\nanswer = f\"Answer to '{question}' using context.\" # Replace with actual LLM call\ngeneration.update(output={\"answer\": answer})\n# Update the trace with the input and output\ngeneration.update_trace(\ninput={\"question\": question, \"context\": context},\noutput={\"answer\": answer},\n)\nreturn answer\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) # Fetch your pre-populated dataset\nfor item in dataset.items:\nprint(f\"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})\")\n# Use the item.run() context manager\nwith item.run(\nrun_name=current_run_name,\nrun_metadata={\"model_provider\": \"OpenAI\", \"temperature_setting\": 0.7},\nrun_description=\"Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th\"\n) as root_span: # root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.\n# All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.\n# Call your application logic\ngenerated_answer = my_qna_app(\nquestion=item.input[\"question\"],\ncontext=item.input[\"context\"],\nitem_id=item.id,\nrun_name=current_run_name\n)\nprint(f\" Item {item.id} processed. Trace ID: {root_span.trace_id}\")\n# Optionally, score the result against the expected output\nif item.expected_output and generated_answer == item.expected_output.get(\"answer\"):\nroot_span.score_trace(name=\"exact_match\", value=1.0)\nelse:\nroot_span.score_trace(name=\"exact_match\", value=0.0)\nprint(f\"\\nFinished processing dataset '{dataset_name}' for run '{current_run_name}'.\")\nBy using item.run()\n, you ensure each dataset item\u2019s processing is neatly encapsulated in its own trace, and these traces are aggregated under the specified run_name\nin the Langfuse UI. This allows for systematic review of results, comparison across runs, and deep dives into individual processing traces.", "links": [{"href":

Langfuse", "text": "Advanced Usage\nThe Python SDK provides advanced usage options for your application. This includes data masking, logging, sampling, filtering, and more.\nMasking Sensitive Data\nIf your trace data (inputs, outputs, metadata) might contain sensitive information (PII, secrets), you can provide a mask\nfunction during client initialization. This function will be applied to all relevant data before it\u2019s sent to Langfuse.\nThe mask\nfunction should accept data\nas a keyword argument and return the masked data. The returned data must be JSON-serializable.\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nimport re\ndef pii_masker(data: any, **kwargs) -> any:\n# Example: Simple email masking. Implement your more robust logic here.\nif isinstance(data, str):\nreturn re.sub(r\"[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+\", \"[EMAIL_REDACTED]\", data)\nelif isinstance(data, dict):\nreturn {k: pii_masker(data=v) for k, v in data.items()}\nelif isinstance(data, list):\nreturn [pii_masker(data=item) for item in data]\nreturn data\nlangfuse = Langfuse(mask=pii_masker)\n# Now, any input/output/metadata will be passed through pii_masker\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"user-query\", input={\"email\": \"[email protected]\", \"query\": \"...\"}) as span:\n# The 'email' field in the input will be masked.\npass\nLogging\nThe Langfuse SDK uses Python\u2019s standard logging\nmodule. The main logger is named \"langfuse\"\n.\nTo enable detailed debug logging, you can either:\n- Set the\ndebug=True\nparameter when initializing theLangfuse\nclient. - Set the\nLANGFUSE_DEBUG=\"True\"\nenvironment variable. - Configure the\n\"langfuse\"\nlogger manually:\nimport logging\nlangfuse_logger = logging.getLogger(\"langfuse\")\nlangfuse_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nThe default log level for the langfuse\nlogger is logging.WARNING\n.\nSampling\nYou can configure the SDK to sample traces by setting the sample_rate\nparameter during client initialization (or via the LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE\nenvironment variable). This value should be a float between 0.0\n(sample 0% of traces) and 1.0\n(sample 100% of traces).\nIf a trace is not sampled, none of its observations (spans, generations) or associated scores will be sent to Langfuse.\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\n# Sample approximately 20% of traces\nlangfuse_sampled = Langfuse(sample_rate=0.2)\nFiltering by Instrumentation Scope\nYou can configure the SDK to filter out spans from specific instrumentation libraries by using the blocked_instrumentation_scopes\nparameter. This is useful when you want to exclude infrastructure spans while keeping your LLM and application spans.\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\n# Filter out database spans\nlangfuse = Langfuse(\nblocked_instrumentation_scopes=[\"sqlalchemy\", \"psycopg\"]\n)\nHow it works:\nWhen third-party libraries create OpenTelemetry spans (through their instrumentation packages), each span has an associated \u201cinstrumentation scope\u201d that identifies which library created it. The Langfuse SDK filters spans at the export level based on these scope names.\nYou can see the instrumentation scope name for any span in the Langfuse UI under the span\u2019s metadata (metadata.scope.name\n). Use this to identify which scopes you want to filter.\nCross-Library Span Relationships\nWhen filtering instrumentation scopes, be aware that blocking certain libraries may break trace tree relationships if spans from blocked and non-blocked libraries are nested together.\nFor example, if you block parent spans but keep child spans from a separate library, you may see \u201corphaned\u201d LLM spans whose parent spans were filtered out. This can make traces harder to interpret.\nConsider the impact on trace structure when choosing which scopes to filter.\nIsolated TracerProvider\nYou can configure a separate OpenTelemetry TracerProvider for use with Langfuse. This creates isolation between Langfuse tracing and your other observability systems.\nBenefits of isolation:\n- Langfuse spans won\u2019t be sent to your other observability backends (e.g., Datadog, Jaeger, Zipkin)\n- Third-party library spans won\u2019t be sent to Langfuse\n- Independent configuration and sampling rates\nWhile TracerProviders are isolated, they share the same OpenTelemetry context for tracking active spans. This can cause span relationship issues where:\n- A parent span from one TracerProvider might have children from another TracerProvider\n- Some spans may appear \u201corphaned\u201d if their parent spans belong to a different TracerProvider\n- Trace hierarchies may be incomplete or confusing\nPlan your instrumentation carefully to avoid confusing trace structures.\nfrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nlangfuse_tracer_provider = TracerProvider() # do not set to global tracer provider to keep isolation\nlangfuse = Langfuse(tracer_provider=langfuse_tracer_provider)\nlangfuse.start_span(name=\"myspan\").end() # Span will be isolated from remaining OTEL instrumentation\nUsing ThreadPoolExecutors\nor ProcessPoolExecutors\nThe observe decorator uses Python\u2019s contextvars\nto store the current trace context and to ensure that the observations are correctly associated with the current execution context. However, when using Python\u2019s ThreadPoolExecutors and ProcessPoolExecutors and when spawning threads from inside a trace (i.e. the executor is run inside a decorated function) the decorator will not work correctly as the contextvars\nare not correctly copied to the new threads or processes. There is an existing issue in Python\u2019s standard library and a great explanation in the fastapi repo that discusses this limitation.\nThe recommended workaround is to pass the parent observation id and the trace ID as a keyword argument to each multithreaded execution, thus re-establishing the link to the parent span or trace:\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed\nfrom langfuse import get_client, observe\n@observe\ndef execute_task(*args):\nreturn args\n@observe\ndef execute_groups(task_args):\ntrace_id = get_client().get_current_trace_id()\nobservation_id = get_client().get_current_observation_id()\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor(3) as executor:\nfutures = [\nexecutor.submit(\nexecute_task,\n*task_arg,\nlangfuse_trace_id=trace_id,\nlangfuse_parent_observation_id=observation_id,\n)\nfor task_arg in task_args\n]\nfor future in as_completed(futures):\nfuture.result()\nreturn [f.result() for f in futures]\n@observe()\ndef main():\ntask_args = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"c\", \"d\"]]\nexecute_groups(task_args)\nmain()\nget_client().flush()\nDistributed tracing\nTo maintain the trace context across service / process boundaries, please rely on the OpenTelemetry native context propagation across service / process boundaries as much as possible.\nUsing the trace_context\nargument to \u2018force\u2019 the parent child relationship may lead to unexpected trace updates as the resulting span will be treated as a root span server side.\n- If you are using multiprocessing, see here for details on how to propagate the OpenTelemetry context.\n- If you are using Pydantic Logfire, please set\ndistributed_tracing\ntoTrue\n.\nMulti-Project Setup (Experimental)\nMulti-project setups are experimental and have important limitations regarding third-party OpenTelemetry integrations.\nThe Langfuse Python SDK supports routing traces to different projects within the same application by using multiple public keys. This works because the Langfuse SDK adds a specific span attribute containing the public key to all spans it generates.\nHow it works:\n- Span Attributes: The Langfuse SDK adds a specific span attribute containing the public key to spans it creates\n- Multiple Processors: Multiple span processors are registered onto the global tracer provider, each with their respective exporters bound to a specific public key\n- Filtering: Within each span processor, spans are filtered based on the presence and value of the public key attribute\nImportant Limitation with Third-Party Libraries:\nThird-party libraries that emit OpenTelemetry spans automatically (e.g., HTTP clients, databases, other instrumentation libraries) do not have the Langfuse public key span attribute. As a result:\n- These spans cannot be routed to a specific project\n- They are processed by all span processors and sent to all projects\n- All projects will receive these third-party spans\nWhy is this experimental?\nThis approach requires that the public_key\nparameter be passed to all Langfuse SDK executions across all integrations to ensure proper routing, and third-party spans will appear in all projects.\nInitialization\nTo set up multiple projects, initialize separate Langfuse clients for each project:\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\n# Initialize clients for different projects\nproject_a_client = Langfuse(\npublic_key=\"pk-lf-project-a-...\",\nsecret_key=\"sk-lf-project-a-...\",\nhost=\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\"\n)\nproject_b_client = Langfuse(\npublic_key=\"pk-lf-project-b-...\",\nsecret_key=\"sk-lf-project-b-...\",\nhost=\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\"\n)\nIntegration Usage\nFor all integrations in multi-project setups, you must specify the public_key\nparameter to ensure traces are routed to the correct project.\nObserve Decorator:\nPass langfuse_public_key\nas a keyword argument to the top-most observed function (not the decorator). From Python SDK >= 3.2.2, nested decorated functions will automatically pick up the public key from the execution context they are currently into. Also, calls to get_client\nwill be also aware of the current langfuse_public_key\nin the decorated function execution context, so passing the langfuse_public_key\nhere again is not necessary.\nfrom langfuse import observe\n@observe\ndef nested():\n# get_client call is context aware\n# if it runs inside another decorated function that has\n# langfuse_public_key passed, it does not need passing here again\nget_client().update_current_trace(user_id='myuser')\n@observe\ndef process_data_for_project_a(data):\n# passing `langfuse_public_key` here again is not necessarily\n# as it is stored in execution context\nnested()\nreturn {\"processed\": data}\n@observe\ndef process_data_for_project_b(data):\n# passing `langfuse_public_key` here again is not necessarily\n# as it is stored in execution context\nnested()\nreturn {\"enhanced\": data}\n# Route to Project A\n# Top-most decorated function needs `langfuse_public_key` kwarg\nresult_a = process_data_for_project_a(\ndata=\"input data\",\nlangfuse_public_key=\"pk-lf-project-a-...\"\n)\n# Route to Project B\n# Top-most decorated function needs `langfuse_public_key` kwarg\nresult_b = process_data_for_project_b(\ndata=\"input data\",\nlangfuse_public_key=\"pk-lf-project-b-...\"\n)\nOpenAI Integration:\nAdd langfuse_public_key\nas a keyword argument to the OpenAI execution:\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nclient = openai.OpenAI()\n# Route to Project A\nresponse_a = client.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello from Project A\"}],\nlangfuse_public_key=\"pk-lf-project-a-...\"\n)\n# Route to Project B\nresponse_b = client.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello from Project B\"}],\nlangfuse_public_key=\"pk-lf-project-b-...\"\n)\nLangchain Integration:\nAdd public_key\nto the CallbackHandler constructor:\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n# Create handlers for different projects\nhandler_a = CallbackHandler(public_key=\"pk-lf-project-a-...\")\nhandler_b = CallbackHandler(public_key=\"pk-lf-project-b-...\")\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o\")\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me about {topic}\")\nchain = prompt | llm\n# Route to Project A\nresponse_a = chain.invoke(\n{\"topic\": \"machine learning\"},\nconfig={\"callbacks\": [handler_a]}\n)\n# Route to Project B\nresponse_b = chain.invoke(\n{\"topic\": \"data science\"},\nconfig={\"callbacks\": [handler_b]}\n)\nImportant Considerations:\n- Every Langfuse SDK execution across all integrations must include the appropriate public key parameter\n- Missing public key parameters may result in traces being routed to the default project or lost\n- Third-party OpenTelemetry spans (from HTTP clients, databases, etc.) will appear in all projects since they lack the Langfuse public key attribute\nSelf-signed SSL certificates (self-hosted Langfuse)\nIf you are self-hosting Langfuse and you\u2019d like to use self-signed SSL certificates, you will need to configure the SDK to trust the self-signed certificate:\nChanging SSL settings has major security implications depending on your environment. Be sure you understand these implications before you proceed.\n1. Set OpenTelemetry span exporter to trust self-signed certificate\nOTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_CERTIFICATE=\"/path/to/my-selfsigned-cert.crt\"\n2. Set HTTPX to trust certificate for all other API requests to Langfuse instance\nimport os\nimport httpx\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nhttpx_client = httpx.Client(verify=os.environ[\"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_CERTIFICATE\"])\nlangfuse = Langfuse(httpx_client=httpx_client)\nObservation Types\nLangfuse supports multiple observation types to provide context for different components of LLM applications. The full list of the observation types is document here: Observation types.\nSetting observation types with the @observe\ndecorator\nBy setting the as_type\nparameter in the @observe\ndecorator, you can specify the observation type for a method:\nfrom langfuse import observe\n# Tool calls to external services\n@observe(as_type=\"tool\")\ndef retrieve_context(query):\nresults = vector_store.get(query)\nreturn results\nSetting observation types with client methods and context manager\nWith the Langfuse client, you can directly create an observation with a defined type:\nfrom langfuse import get_client()\nlangfuse = get_client()\ndef process_with_manual_tracing():\ntrace = langfuse.trace(name=\"document-processing\")\n# Create different observation types\nembedding_obs = trace.start_observation(\nas_type=\"embedding\",\nname=\"document-embedding\",\ninput={\"document\": \"text content\"}\n)\nembeddings = generate_embeddings(\"text content\")\nembedding_obs.update(output={\"embeddings\": embeddings})\nembedding_obs.end()\nThe context manager approach provides automatic resource cleanup:\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\ndef process_with_context_managers():\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_observation(\nas_type=\"chain\",\nname=\"retrieval-pipeline\",\n) as chain:\n# Retrieval step\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_observation(\nas_type=\"retriever\",\nname=\"vector-search\",\n) as retriever:\nsearch_results = perform_vector_search(\"user question\")\nretriever.update(output={\"results\": search_results})", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192

Python SDK - Langfuse", "text": "Upgrade from the Python SDK v2\nThe Python SDK v3 introduces significant improvements and changes compared to the legacy v2 SDK. It is not fully backward compatible. This comprehensive guide will help you migrate based on your current integration.\nYou can find a snapshot of the v2 SDK documentation here.\nCore Changes to SDK v2:\n- OpenTelemetry Foundation: v3 is built on OpenTelemetry standards\n- Trace Input/Output: Now derived from root observation by default\n- Trace Attributes (\nuser_id\n,session_id\n, etc.) Can be set via enclosing spans OR directly on integrations using metadata fields (OpenAI call, Langchain invocation) - Context Management: Automatic OTEL context propagation\nMigration Path by Integration Type\n@observe\nDecorator Users\nv2 Pattern:\nfrom langfuse.decorators import langfuse_context, observe\n@observe()\ndef my_function():\n# This was the trace\nlangfuse_context.update_current_trace(user_id=\"user_123\")\nreturn \"result\"\nv3 Migration:\nfrom langfuse import observe, get_client # new import\n@observe()\ndef my_function():\n# This is now the root span, not the trace\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Update trace explicitly\nlangfuse.update_current_trace(user_id=\"user_123\")\nreturn \"result\"\nOpenAI Integration\nv2 Pattern:\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}],\n# Trace attributes directly on the call\nuser_id=\"user_123\",\nsession_id=\"session_456\",\ntags=[\"chat\"],\nmetadata={\"source\": \"app\"}\n)\nv3 Migration:\nIf you do not set additional trace attributes, no changes are needed.\nIf you set additional trace attributes, you have two options:\nOption 1: Use metadata fields (simplest migration):\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}],\nmetadata={\n\"langfuse_user_id\": \"user_123\",\n\"langfuse_session_id\": \"session_456\",\n\"langfuse_tags\": [\"chat\"],\n\"source\": \"app\" # Regular metadata still works\n}\n)\nOption 2: Use enclosing span (for more control):\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"chat-request\") as span:\n# Set trace attributes on the enclosing span\nspan.update_trace(\nuser_id=\"user_123\",\nsession_id=\"session_456\",\ntags=[\"chat\"],\n# Explicit trace input/output for LLM-as-a-judge features\ninput={\"query\": \"Hello\"},\n)\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}],\nmetadata={\"source\": \"app\"}\n)\n# Set trace output explicitly\nspan.update_trace(output={\"response\": response.choices[0].message.content})\nLangChain Integration\nv2 Pattern:\nfrom langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler\nhandler = CallbackHandler(\nuser_id=\"user_123\",\nsession_id=\"session_456\",\ntags=[\"langchain\"]\n)\nresponse = chain.invoke({\"input\": \"Hello\"}, config={\"callbacks\": [handler]})\nv3 Migration:\nYou have two options for setting trace attributes:\nOption 1: Use metadata fields in chain invocation (simplest migration):\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nhandler = CallbackHandler()\nresponse = chain.invoke(\n{\"input\": \"Hello\"},\nconfig={\n\"callbacks\": [handler],\n\"metadata\": {\n\"langfuse_user_id\": \"user_123\",\n\"langfuse_session_id\": \"session_456\",\n\"langfuse_tags\": [\"langchain\"]\n}\n}\n)\nOption 2: Use enclosing span (for more control):\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nfrom langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler\nlangfuse = get_client()\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"langchain-request\") as span:\nspan.update_trace(\nuser_id=\"user_123\",\nsession_id=\"session_456\",\ntags=[\"langchain\"],\ninput={\"query\": \"Hello\"} #

v3: Generate deterministic trace ID from external system external_request_id = \"req_12345\" trace_id = Langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_request_id) @observe(langfuse_trace_id=trace_id) def my_function(): # This trace will have the deterministic ID pass\n-\nInitialization:\n- Replace constructor parameters:\nenabled\n\u2192tracing_enabled\nthreads\n\u2192media_upload_thread_count\n- Replace constructor parameters:\n-\nDatasets\nThe link\nmethod on the dataset item objects has been replaced by a context manager that can be accessed via the run\nmethod on the dataset items. This is a higher level abstraction that manages trace creation and linking of the dataset item with the resulting trace.\nSee the datasets documentation for more details.\nDetailed Change Summary\n-\nCore Change: OpenTelemetry Foundation\n- Built on OpenTelemetry standards for better ecosystem compatibility\n-\nTrace Input/Output Behavior\n- v2: Integrations could set trace input/output directly\n- v3: Trace input/output derived from root observation by default\n- Migration: Explicitly set via\nspan.update_trace(input=..., output=...)\n-\nTrace Attributes Location\n- v2: Could be set directly on integration calls\n- v3: Must be set on enclosing spans\n- Migration: Wrap integration calls with\nlangfuse.start_as_current_span()\n-\nCreating Observations:\n- v2:\nlangfuse.trace()\n,langfuse.span()\n,langfuse.generation()\n- v3:\nlangfuse.start_as_current_span()\n,langfuse.start_as_current_generation()\n- Migration: Use context managers, ensure\n.end()\nis called or usewith\nstatements\n- v2:\n-\nIDs and Context:\n- v3: W3C Trace Context format, automatic context propagation\n- Migration: Use\nlangfuse.get_current_trace_id()\ninstead ofget_trace_id()\n-\nEvent Size Limitations:\n- v2: Events were limited to 1MB in size\n- v3: No size limits enforced on the SDK-side for events\nFuture support for v2\nWe will continue to support the v2 SDK for the foreseeable future with critical bug fixes and security patches. We will not be adding any new features to the v2 SDK.

find a solution to your issue here, try using Ask AI for instant answers. For bug reports, please open a ticket on GitHub Issues. For general questions or support, visit our support page.\n- Authentication Issues:\n- Ensure\nLANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\n,LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\n, andLANGFUSE_HOST\n(if not using default cloud) are correctly set either as environment variables or in theLangfuse()\nconstructor. - Use\nlangfuse.auth_check()\nafter initialization to verify credentials. Do not use this in production as this method waits for a response from the server.\n- Ensure\n- No Traces Appearing:\n- Check if\ntracing_enabled\nisTrue\n(default). - Verify\nsample_rate\nis not0.0\n. - Ensure\nlangfuse.shutdown()\nis called or the program exits cleanly to allowatexit\nhooks to flush data. Manually calllangfuse.flush()\nto force data sending. - Enable debug logging (\ndebug=True\norLANGFUSE_DEBUG=\"True\"\n) to see SDK activity and potential errors during exporting.\n- Check if\n- Incorrect Nesting or Missing Spans:\n- If you are self-hosting Langfuse, the Python SDK v3 requires Langfuse platform version >= 3.63.0 for traces to be correctly processed. You can find a snapshot of the legacy v2 SDK documentation here.\n- Ensure you are using context managers (\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(...)\n) for proper context propagation. - If manually creating spans (\nlangfuse.start_span()\n), ensure they are correctly ended with.end()\n. - In async code, ensure context is not lost across\nawait\nboundaries if not using Langfuse\u2019s async-compatible methods.\n- Langchain/OpenAI Integration Not Working:\n- Confirm the respective integration (e.g.,\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\norLangfuseCallbackHandler\n) is correctly set up before the calls to the LLM libraries are made. - Check for version compatibility issues between Langfuse, Langchain, and OpenAI SDKs.\n- Confirm the respective integration (e.g.,\n- Media Not Appearing:\n- Ensure\nLangfuseMedia\nobjects are correctly initialized and passed ininput\n,output\n, ormetadata\n. - Check debug logs for any media upload errors. Media uploads happen in background threads.\n- Ensure\nIf you encounter persistent issues, please:\n- Enable debug logging to gather more information.\n- Check the Langfuse status page (if applicable for cloud users).\n- Raise an issue on our GitHub repository with details about your setup, SDK version, code snippets, and debug logs.\nWas this page helpful?", "links": [{"href":

Configuration - Langfuse", "text": "TypeScript SDK - Advanced Configuration\nMasking\nTo prevent sensitive data from being sent to Langfuse, you can provide a mask\nfunction to the LangfuseSpanProcessor\n. This function will be applied to the input\n, output\n, and metadata\nof every observation.\nThe function receives an object { data }\n, where data\nis the stringified JSON of the attribute\u2019s value. It should return the masked data.\nimport { NodeSDK } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\";\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \"@langfuse/otel\";\nconst spanProcessor = new LangfuseSpanProcessor({\nmask: ({ data }) => {\n// A simple regex to mask credit card numbers\nconst maskedData = data.replace(\n/\\b\\d{4}[- ]?\\d{4}[- ]?\\d{4}[- ]?\\d{4}\\b/g,\n\"***MASKED_CREDIT_CARD***\"\n);\nreturn maskedData;\n},\n});\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\nspanProcessors: [spanProcessor],\n});\nsdk.start();\nFiltering Spans\nYou can provide a predicate function shouldExportSpan\nto the LangfuseSpanProcessor\nto decide on a per-span basis whether it should be exported to Langfuse.\nFiltering spans may break the parent-child relationships in your traces. For\nexample, if you filter out a parent span but keep its children, you may see\n\u201corphaned\u201d observations in the Langfuse UI. Consider the impact on trace\nstructure when configuring shouldExportSpan\n.\nimport { NodeSDK } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\";\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor, ShouldExportSpan } from \"@langfuse/otel\";\n// Example: Filter out all spans from the 'express' instrumentation\nconst shouldExportSpan: ShouldExportSpan = ({ otelSpan }) =>\notelSpan.instrumentationScope.name !== \"express\";\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\nspanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor({ shouldExportSpan })],\n});\nsdk.start();\nIf you want to include only LLM observability related spans, you can configure an allowlist like so:\nimport { ShouldExportSpan } from \"@langfuse/otel\";\nconst shouldExportSpan: ShouldExportSpan = ({ otelSpan }) =>\n[\"langfuse-sdk\", \"ai\"].includes(otelSpan.instrumentationScope.name);\nIf you would like to exclude Langfuse spans from being sent to third-party observability backends configured in your OpenTelemetry setup, see the documentation on isolating the Langfuse tracer provider.\nSampling\nLangfuse respects OpenTelemetry\u2019s sampling decisions. You can configure a sampler in your OTEL SDK to control which traces are sent to Langfuse. This is useful for managing costs and reducing noise in high-volume applications.\nHere is an example of how to configure a TraceIdRatioBasedSampler\nto send only 20% of traces:\nimport { NodeSDK } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\";\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \"@langfuse/otel\";\nimport { TraceIdRatioBasedSampler } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base\";\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\n// Sample 20% of all traces\nsampler: new TraceIdRatioBasedSampler(0.2),\nspanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()],\n});\nsdk.start();\nFor more advanced sampling strategies, refer to the OpenTelemetry JS Sampling Documentation.\nManaging trace and observation IDs\nIn Langfuse, every trace and observation has a unique identifier. Understanding their format and how to set them is useful for integrating with other systems.\n- Trace IDs are 32-character lowercase hexadecimal strings, representing 16 bytes of data\n- Observation IDs (also known as Span IDs in OpenTelemetry) are 16-character lowercase hexadecimal strings, representing 8 bytes\nWhile the SDK handles ID generation automatically, you may manually set them to align with external systems or create specific trace structures. This is done using the parentSpanContext\noption in tracing methods.\nWhen starting a new trace by setting a traceId\n, you must also provide an arbitrary parent-spanId\nfor the parent observation. The parent span ID value is irrelevant as long as it is a valid 16-hexchar string as the span does not actually exist but is only used for trace ID inheritance of the created observation.\nYou can create valid, deterministic trace IDs from a seed string using createTraceId\n. This is useful for correlating Langfuse traces with IDs from external systems, like a support ticket ID.\nimport { createTraceId, startObservation } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\nconst externalId = \"support-ticket-54321\";\n// Generate a valid, deterministic traceId from the external ID\nconst langfuseTraceId = await createTraceId(externalId);\n// You can now start a new trace with this ID\nconst rootSpan = startObservation(\n\"process-ticket\",\n{},\n{\nparentSpanContext: {\ntraceId: langfuseTraceId,\nspanId: \"0123456789abcdef\", // A valid 16 hexchar string; value is irrelevant as parent span does not exist but only used for inheritance\ntraceFlags: 1, // mark trace as sampled\n},\n}\n);\n// Later, you can regenerate the same traceId to score or retrieve the trace\nconst scoringTraceId = await createTraceId(externalId);\n// scoringTraceId will be the same as langfuseTraceId\nYou may also access the current active trace ID via the getActiveTraceId\nfunction:\nimport { startObservation, getActiveTraceId } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\nawait startObservation(\"run\", async (span) => {\nconst traceId = getActiveTraceId();\nconsole.log(`Current trace ID: ${traceId}`);\n});\nLogging\nYou can configure the global SDK logger to control the verbosity of log output. This is useful for debugging.\nIn code:\nimport { configureGlobalLogger, LogLevel } from \"@langfuse/core\";\n// Set the log level to DEBUG to see all log messages\nconfigureGlobalLogger({ level: LogLevel.DEBUG });\nAvailable log levels are DEBUG\n, INFO\n, WARN\n, and ERROR\n.\nVia environment variable:\nYou can also set the log level using the LANGFUSE_LOG_LEVEL\nenvironment variable.\nexport LANGFUSE_LOG_LEVEL=\"DEBUG\"\nServerless environments\nIn short-lived environments such as serverless functions (e.g., Vercel Functions, AWS Lambda), you must explicitly flush the traces before the process exits or the runtime environment is frozen.\nExport the processor from your OTEL SDK setup file in order to flush it later.\nimport { NodeSDK } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\";\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \"@langfuse/otel\";\n// Export the processor to be able to flush it\nexport const langfuseSpanProcessor = new LangfuseSpanProcessor();\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\nspanProcessors: [langfuseSpanProcessor],\n});\nsdk.start();\nIn your serverless function handler, call forceFlush()\non the span processor before the function exits.\nimport { langfuseSpanProcessor } from \"./instrumentation\";\nexport async function handler(event, context) {\n// ... your application logic ...\n// Flush before exiting\nawait langfuseSpanProcessor.forceFlush();\n}\nIsolated tracer provider\nThe Langfuse JS SDK uses the global OpenTelemetry TracerProvider to attach its span processor and create tracers that emit spans. This means that if you have an existing OpenTelemetry setup with another destination configured for your spans (e.g., Datadog), you will see Langfuse spans in those third-party observability backends as well.\nIf you\u2019d like to avoid sending Langfuse spans to third-party observability backends in your existing OpenTelemetry setup, you will need to use an isolated OpenTelemetry TracerProvider that is separate from the global one.\nIf you would like to simply limit the spans that are sent to Langfuse and you have no third-party observability backend where you\u2019d like to exclude Langfuse spans from, see filtering spans instead.\nUsing an isolated TracerProvider may break the parent-child relationships in your traces, as all TracerProviders still share the same active span context. For example, if you have an active parent span from the global TracerProvider but children from an isolated TracerProvider, you may see \u201corphaned\u201d observations in the Langfuse UI. Consider the impact on trace structure when configuring an isolated tracer provider.\nimport { NodeTracerProvider } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node\";\nimport { setLangfuseTracerProvider } from \"@langfuse/tracing\";\n// Create a new TracerProvider and register the LangfuseSpanProcessor\n// do not set this TracerProvider as the global TracerProvider\nconst langfuseTracerProvider = new NodeTracerProvider(\nspanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()],\n)\n// Register the isolated TracerProvider\nsetLangfuseTracerProvider(langfuseTracerProvider)\nMulti-project Setup\nYou can configure the SDK to send traces to multiple Langfuse projects. This is useful for multi-tenant applications or for sending traces to different environments. Simply register multiple LangfuseSpanProcessor\ninstances, each with its own credentials.\nimport { NodeSDK } from \"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\";\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \"@langfuse/otel\";\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\nspanProcessors: [\nnew LangfuseSpanProcessor({\npublicKey: \"pk-lf-public-key-project-1\",\nsecretKey: \"sk-lf-secret-key-project-1\",\n}),\nnew LangfuseSpanProcessor({\npublicKey: \"pk-lf-public-key-project-2\",\nsecretKey: \"sk-lf-secret-key-project-2\",\n}),\n],\n});\nsdk.start();\nThis configuration will send every trace to both projects. You can also configure a custom shouldExportSpan\nfilter for each processor to control which traces go to which project.\nCustom scores from browser\nSending custom scores directly from the browser is not yet supported in the TypeScript SDK v4. The docs below describe the still valid approach with the SDK v3.\nThe TypeScript SDK can be used to report custom scores client-side directly from the browser. It is commonly used to ingest scores into Langfuse which are based on implicit user interactions and feedback.\nExample\nimport { LangfuseWeb } from \"langfuse\";\nexport function UserFeedbackComponent(props: { traceId: string }) {\nconst langfuseWeb = new LangfuseWeb({\npublicKey: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,\nbaseUrl: \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\", // \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa EU region\n// baseUrl: \"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\", // \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US region\n});\nconst handleUserFeedback = async (value: number) =>\nawait langfuseWeb.score({\ntraceId: props.traceId,\nname: \"user_feedback\",\nvalue,\n});\nreturn (\n<div>\n<button onClick={() => handleUserFeedback(1)}>\ud83d\udc4d</button>\n<button onClick={() => handleUserFeedback(0)}>\ud83d\udc4e</button>\n</div>\n);\n}\nWe integrated the Web SDK into the Vercel AI Chatbot project to collect user feedback on individual messages. Read the blog post for more details and code examples.\nInstallation\nnpm i langfuse # this is still the v3 installation as v4 does not yet support scores from browser env\nIn your application, set the public api key to create a client.\nimport { LangfuseWeb } from \"langfuse\";\nconst langfuseWeb = new LangfuseWeb({\npublicKey: \"pk-lf-...\",\nbaseUrl: \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\", // \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa EU region\n// baseUrl: \"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\", // \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US region\n});\nHint for Next.js users: you need to prefix the public key with NEXT_PUBLIC_\nto expose it in the frontend.\nNever set your Langfuse secret key in public browser code. The LangfuseWeb\nrequires only the public key.\nCreate custom scores\nScores are used to evaluate executions/traces. They are attached to a single trace. If the score relates to a specific step of the trace, the score can optionally also be attached to the observation to enable evaluating it specifically.\nWhile integrating Langfuse, it is important to either include the Langfuse Ids in the response to the frontend or to use an own id as the trace id which is available in both backend and frontend.\n// pass traceId and observationId to front end\nawait langfuseWeb.score({\ntraceId: message.traceId,\nobservationId: message.observationId,\nname: \"user-feedback\",\nvalue: 1,\ncomment: \"I like how personalized the response is\",\n});\nLearn

For chat prompts, this is a list of chat messages each withrole\nandcontent\nbut can also contain placeholders.config\n: Optional JSON object to store any parameters (e.g. model parameters or model tools).version\n: Integer to indicate the version of the prompt. The version is automatically incremented when creating a new prompt version.labels\n: Labels that can be used to fetch specific prompt versions in the SDKs.- When using a prompt without specifying a label, Langfuse will serve the version with the\nproduction\nlabel. latest\npoints to the most recently created version.- You can create any additional labels, e.g. for different environments (\nstaging\n,production\n) or tenants (tenant-1\n,tenant-2\n).\n- When using a prompt without specifying a label, Langfuse will serve the version with the\ntags\n: Use tags to categorize prompts, e.g. to filter them in the UI or SDKs. All versions of a prompt share the same tags.\nChat vs Text prompts\nLangfuse supports two types of prompts: text and chat. The key difference is in how the content is structured:\nText Prompts\nText prompts contain a single string with optional variables. They are ideal for simple completions or when using models that expect a single text input.\n{\n\"name\": \"movie-critic\",\n\"type\": \"text\",\n\"prompt\": \"As a {{criticLevel}} movie critic, do you like {{movie}}?\",\n\"version\": 1\n}\nWhen compiled, text prompts return a single string:\n# Returns: \"As an expert movie critic, do you like Dune 2?\"\nChat Prompts\nChat prompts contain an array of messages, each with a role\nand content\n. They are designed for conversational models and multi-turn interactions.\n{\n\"name\": \"movie-critic-chat\",\n\"type\": \"chat\",\n\"prompt\": [\n{\n\"role\": \"system\",\n\"content\": \"You are a {{criticLevel}} movie critic\"\n},\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": \"Do you like {{movie}}?\"\n}\n],\n\"version\": 1\n}\nWhen compiled, chat prompts return an array of message objects:\n# Returns: [\n# {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an expert movie critic\"},\n# {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Do you like Dune 2?\"}\n# ]\nBoth prompt types support variable substitution using {{variable}}\nsyntax and can include custom configuration parameters.\nVersioning and Labels\nLangfuse prompt versioning automatically creates incremental versions (1, 2, 3\u2026) each time you update a prompt with the same name, while labels act as pointers to specific versions for deployment management. The production\nlabel serves as the default version returned by SDKs when no specific label is requested, latest\nautomatically points to the most recently created version, and you can create custom labels (like staging\n, tenant-1\n, or prod-a\n) to manage different environments, tenants, or A/B testing scenarios - allowing you to safely deploy, test, and rollback prompts by simply reassigning labels rather than changing code.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192 Langfuse TypeScript SDK v4 is here

To avoid duplication, you can compose prompts by referencing other prompts.\nWhy Use Composed Prompts?\n- Create modular prompt components that can be reused across multiple prompts\n- Maintain common instructions, examples, or context in a single place\n- Update dependent prompts automatically when base prompts change\nGet started\nWhen creating the prompt via the Langfuse UI, you can use the Add

Each variant keeps its own LLM settings, variables, tool definitions, and placeholders so you can immediately see the impact of every change.\nOpen your prompt in the playground\nYou can open a prompt you created with Langfuse Prompt Management in the playground.\nSave your prompt to Prompt Management\nWhen you\u2019re satisfied with your prompt, you can save it to Prompt Management by clicking the save button.\nOpen a generation in the playground\nYou can open a generation from Langfuse Observability in the playground by clicking the Open in Playground\nbutton in the generation details page.\nTool calling and structured outputs\nThe Langfuse Playground supports tool calling and structured output schemas, enabling you to define, test, and validate LLM executions that rely on tool calls and enforce specific response formats.\nTool Calling\n- Define custom tools with JSON schema definitions\n- Test prompts relying on tools in real-time by mocking tool responses\n- Save tool definitions to your project\nStructured Output\n- Enforce response formats using JSON schemas\n- Save schemas to your project\n- Jump into the playground from your OpenAI generation using structured output\nAdd prompt variables\nYou can add prompt variables in the playground to simulate different inputs to your prompt.\nUse your favorite model\nYou can use your favorite model by adding the API key for the model you want to use in the Langfuse project settings. You can learn how to set up an LLM connection here.\nOptionally, many LLM providers allow for additional parameters when invoking a model. You can pass these parameters in the playground when toggling \u201cAdditional Options\u201d in the model selection dropdown. Read this documentation about additional provider options for more information.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA

"text": "Native Dataset Runs (Prompt Experiments)\nYou can execute Native Dataset Runs (also called Prompt Experiments) in the Langfuse UI to test different prompt versions from Prompt Management or language models and compare the results side-by-side.\nOptionally, you can use LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluators to automatically score the responses based on the expected outputs to further analyze the results on an aggregate level.\nThey are called \u201cNative Dataset Runs\u201d because they rely on Datasets, Prompts and optionally LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluators all being managed natively in Langfuse.\nWhy use Native Dataset Runs (Prompt Experiments)?\n- Quickly test different prompt versions or models\n- Structure your prompt testing by using a dataset to test different prompt versions and models\n- Quickly iterate on prompts through Dataset Runs\n- Optionally use LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluators to score the responses based on the expected outputs from the dataset\n- Prevent regressions by running tests when making prompt changes\nPrerequisites\nCreate a usable prompt\nCreate a prompt that you want to test and evaluate. How to create a prompt?\nA prompt is usable when: your prompt has variables that match the dataset item keys in the dataset that will be used for the Dataset Run. See the example below.\nExample: Prompt Variables & Dataset Item Keys Mapping\nPrompt:\n{{ documentation }}\nQuestion: {{question}}\nDataset Item:\n{\n\"documentation\": \"Langfuse is an LLM Engineering Platform\",\n\"question\": \"What is Langfuse?\"\n}\nIn this example:\n- The prompt variable\n{{documentation}}\nmaps to the JSON key\"documentation\"\n- The prompt variable\n{{question}}\nmaps to the JSON key\"question\"\n- Both keys must exist in the dataset item\u2019s input JSON for the experiment to run successfully\nExample: Chat Message Placeholder Mapping\nIn addition to variables, you can also map placeholders in chat message prompts to dataset item keys. This is useful when the dataset item also contains for example a chat message history to use. Your chat prompt needs to contain a placeholder with a name. Variables within placeholders are not resolved.\nChat Prompt:\nPlaceholder named: message_history\nDataset Item:\n{\n\"message_history\": [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": \"What is Langfuse?\"\n},\n{\n\"role\": \"assistant\",\n\"content\": \"Langfuse is a tool for tracking and analyzing the performance of language models.\"\n}\n],\n\"question\": \"What is Langfuse?\"\n}\nIn this example:\n- The chat prompt placeholder\nmessage_history\nmaps to the JSON key\"message_history\"\n. - The prompt variable\n{{question}}\nmaps to the JSON key\"question\"\nin a variable not within a placeholder message. - Both keys must exist in the dataset item\u2019s input JSON for the experiment to run successfully\nCreate a usable dataset\nCreate a dataset with the inputs and expected outputs you want to use for your prompt experiments. How to create a dataset?\nA dataset is usable when: [1] the dataset items have JSON objects as input and [2] these objects have JSON keys that match the prompt variables of the prompt(s) you will use. See the example below.\nExample: Prompt Variables & Dataset Item Keys Mapping\nPrompt:\n{{ documentation }}\nQuestion: {{question}}\nDataset Item:\n{\n\"documentation\": \"Langfuse is an LLM Engineering Platform\",\n\"question\": \"What is Langfuse?\"\n}\nIn this example:\n- The prompt variable\n{{documentation}}\nmaps to the JSON key\"documentation\"\n- The prompt variable\n{{question}}\nmaps to the JSON key\"question\"\n- Both keys must exist in the dataset item\u2019s input JSON for the experiment to run successfully\nConfigure LLM connection\nAs your prompt will be executed for each dataset item, you need to configure an LLM connection in the project settings. How to configure an LLM connection?\nOptional: Set up LLM-as-a-judge\nYou can set up an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator to score the responses based on the expected outputs. Make sure to set the target of the LLM-as-a-Judge to \u201cExperiment runs\u201d and filter for the dataset you want to use. How to set up LLM-as-a-judge?\nTrigger a Native Dataset Run (Prompt Experiment)\nNavigate to the dataset\nDataset Runs are currently started from the detail page of a dataset.\n- Navigate to\nYour Project\n>Datasets\n- Click on the dataset you want to start a Dataset Run for\nOpen the setup page\nClick on Start Experiment\nto open the setup page\nClick on Create\nbelow prompt Experiment\nConfigure the Dataset Run\n- Set a Dataset Run name\n- Select the prompt you want to use\n- Set up or select the LLM connection you want to use\n- Select the dataset you want to use\n- Optionally select the evaluator you want to use\n- Click on\nCreate\nto trigger the Dataset Run\nThis will trigger the Dataset Run and you will be redirected to the Dataset Runs page. The run might take a few seconds or minutes to complete depending on the prompt complexity and dataset size.\nCompare runs\nAfter each experiment run, you can check the aggregated score in the Dataset Runs table and compare results side-by-side.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192 Langfuse TypeScript SDK v4 is

Prompts - Langfuse", "text": "A/B Testing of LLM Prompts\nLangfuse Prompt Management enables A/B testing by allowing you to label different versions of a prompt (e.g., prod-a\nand prod-b\n). Your application can randomly alternate between these versions, while Langfuse tracks performance metrics like response latency, cost, token usage, and evaluation metrics for each version.\nWhen to use A/B testing?\nA/B testing helps you see how different prompt versions work in real situations, adding to what you learn from testing on datasets. This works best when:\n- Your app has good ways to measure success, deals with many different kinds of user inputs, and can handle some ups and downs in performance. This usually works for consumer apps where mistakes aren\u2019t a big deal.\n- You\u2019ve already tested thoroughly on your test data and want to try your changes with a small group of users before rolling out to everyone (also called canary deployment).\nImplementation\nLabel your Prompt Versions\nLabel your prompt versions (e.g., prod-a\nand prod-b\n) to identify different variants for testing.\nFetch Prompts and Run A/B Test\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nimport random\nfrom langfuse.openai import openai\n# Requires environment variables for initialization\nfrom langfuse import

analytics\nlangfuse_prompt=selected_prompt\n)\nresult_text = response.choices[0].message.content\nRefer to prompt management documentation for additional examples on how to fetch and use prompts.\nAnalyze Results\nCompare metrics for each prompt version in the Langfuse UI:\nKey metrics available for comparison:\n- Response latency and token usage\n- Cost per request\n- Quality

of Prompts in Client SDKs\nLangfuse prompts are cached client-side in the SDKs, so there\u2019s no latency impact after the first use and no availability risk. You can also pre-fetch prompts on startup to populate the cache or provide a fallback prompt.\nWhen the SDK cache contains a fresh prompt, it\u2019s returned immediately without any network requests.\nOptional: Customize caching duration (TTL)\nThe caching duration is configurable if you wish to reduce network overhead of the Langfuse Client. The default cache TTL is 60 seconds. After the TTL expires, the SDKs will refetch the prompt in the background and update the cache. Refetching is done asynchronously and does not block the application.\n# Get current `production` prompt version and cache for 5 minutes\nprompt = langfuse.get_prompt(\"movie-critic\", cache_ttl_seconds=300)\nOptional: Disable caching\nYou can disable caching by setting the cacheTtlSeconds\nto 0\n. This will ensure that the prompt is fetched from the Langfuse API on every call. This is recommended for non-production use cases where you want to ensure that the prompt is always up to date with the latest version in Langfuse.\nprompt = langfuse.get_prompt(\"movie-critic\", cache_ttl_seconds=0)\n# Common in non-production environments, no cache + latest version\nprompt = langfuse.get_prompt(\"movie-critic\", cache_ttl_seconds=0, label=\"latest\")\nOptional: Guaranteed availability of prompts\nWhile usually not necessary, you can ensure 100% availability of prompts by pre-fetching them on application startup and providing a fallback prompt. Please follow this guide for more information.\nPerformance measurement of inital fetch\nWe measured the execution time of the following snippet with fully disabled caching. You can run this notebook yourself to verify the results.\nprompt = langfuse.get_prompt(\"perf-test\", cache_ttl_seconds=0)\nprompt.compile(input=\"test\")\nResults from 1000 sequential executions

Prompts - Langfuse", "text": "GitHub Integration for Langfuse Prompts\nThere are two methods to integrate Langfuse prompts with GitHub:\n- GitHub Actions Webhook - Trigger CI/CD workflows when prompts change. This does not require additional infrastructure.\n- Sync Langfuse Prompts to a repository - Store prompts in a specific file in your repository. This involves a webhook server that listens for prompt version changes and commits them to the repository.\nTrigger GitHub Actions\nTrigger GitHub Actions workflows when Langfuse prompts change using repository_dispatch\nevents.\n1. Create GitHub Workflow\n.github/workflows/langfuse-ci.yml\n:\nname: Langfuse Prompt CI\non:\nrepository_dispatch:\ntypes: [langfuse-prompt-update]\nworkflow_dispatch:\njobs:\ntest:\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v4\n- name: Run tests\nrun: |\necho \"Testing prompt: ${{ github.event.client_payload.prompt.name }} v${{ github.event.client_payload.prompt.version }}\"\n# Add your test commands\n# npm test\n# python -m pytest\ndeploy:\nneeds: test\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nif: contains(github.event.client_payload.prompt.labels, 'production')\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v4\n- name: Deploy to production\nrun: |\necho \"Deploying ${{ github.event.client_payload.prompt.name }} v${{ github.event.client_payload.prompt.version }}\"\n# Your deployment commands\nAccessing webhook data: Use github.event.client_payload.*\nto access prompt data:\n# Example: Access webhook data in your workflow\n- name: Process prompt data\nrun: |\necho \"Action: ${{ github.event.client_payload.action }}\"\necho \"Prompt: ${{ github.event.client_payload.prompt.name }}\"\necho \"Version: ${{ github.event.client_payload.prompt.version }}\"\necho \"Labels: ${{ github.event.client_payload.prompt.labels }}\"\n- name: Deploy only production prompts\nif: contains(github.event.client_payload.prompt.labels, 'production')\nrun: echo \"Deploying production prompt\"\n2. Create GitHub Token for Actions\nSteps:\n- GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens\n- Generate new token (classic or fine-grained)\n- Select scope (see table below)\n3. Configure Langfuse Webhook for Actions\n- Go to Prompts > Webhooks in your Langfuse project\n- Click Create Webhook\n- Set endpoint URL:\nhttps://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/dispatches\n- Add headers:\nAccept: application/vnd.github+json\nAuthorization: Bearer {your_github_token}\nImportant: Store your GitHub token securely in the Authorization header. Langfuse encrypts webhook headers and stores them securely.\n4. Test GitHub Actions Integration\n- Update a prompt in Langfuse with the\nproduction\nlabel - Check GitHub Actions tab for triggered workflow\n- Verify that both test and deploy jobs run successfully\nSync Langfuse Prompts to a repository\nAutomatically sync prompt changes from Langfuse to GitHub using Prompt Version Webhooks. This enables version control for prompts and can trigger CI/CD workflows.\nOverview of the Sync Workflow\nWhenever you save a new prompt version in Langfuse, it\u2019s automatically committed to your GitHub repository. With this setup, you can also trigger CI/CD workflows when prompts change.\nPrerequisites for Sync\n- Langfuse Project: Prompt setup with Project Owner access\n- GitHub Repository: Public or private repo to store prompts\n- GitHub PAT: Personal Access Token with minimum required permissions (see Step 2 for details)\n- Python 3.9+ (for the example below, can be any language) with FastAPI, Uvicorn, httpx, Pydantic\n- Public HTTPS endpoint for your webhook server (Render, Fly.io, Heroku, etc.)\nStep 1: Configure a Prompt Webhook in Langfuse\n- Go to Prompts > Webhooks in your Langfuse project\n- Click Create Webhook\n- (optional) filter events: filter by which prompt version events to receive webhooks (default:\ncreated\n,updated\n,deleted\n) - Set endpoint URL:\nhttps://<your-domain>/webhook/prompt\n- Save and copy the Signing Secret\nNote: Your endpoint must return 2xx status codes. Langfuse retries failed webhooks with exponential backoff.\nSample Webhook Payload\nSample webhook payload:\n{\n\"id\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",\n\"timestamp\": \"2024-07-10T10:30:00Z\",\n\"type\": \"prompt-version\",\n\"action\": \"created\",\n\"prompt\": {\n\"id\": \"prompt_abc123\",\n\"name\": \"movie-critic\",\n\"version\": 3,\n\"projectId\": \"xyz789\",\n\"labels\": [\"production\", \"latest\"],\n\"prompt\": \"As a {{criticLevel}} movie critic, rate {{movie}} out of 10.\",\n\"type\": \"text\",\n\"config\": { \"...\": \"...\" },\n\"commitMessage\": \"Improved critic persona\",\n\"tags\": [\"entertainment\"],\n\"createdAt\": \"2024-07-10T10:30:00Z\",\n\"updatedAt\": \"2024-07-10T10:30:00Z\"\n}\n}\nStep 2: Prepare Your GitHub Repo and Token for Sync\nCreate a .env\nfile with your GitHub credentials:\nGITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_pat_here>\nGITHUB_REPO_OWNER=<github_username_or_org>\nGITHUB_REPO_NAME=<repo_name>\n# (Optional) GITHUB_FILE_PATH=langfuse_prompt.json\n# (Optional) GITHUB_BRANCH=main\n# (Optional) REQUIRED_LABEL=production\nReplace placeholders with your actual values. The server will commit prompts to langfuse_prompt.json\non the main\nbranch by default. If REQUIRED_LABEL\nis set, only prompts with that specific label will be synced to GitHub.\nGitHub PAT Permissions for Sync\nFor the webhook to work, your GitHub Personal Access Token needs minimal permissions:\nStep 3: Implement the FastAPI Webhook Server\nCreate main.py\nwith this FastAPI server:\nfrom typing import Any, Dict\nfrom uuid import UUID\nimport json\nimport base64\nimport httpx\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Body\nclass GitHubSettings(BaseSettings):\n\"\"\"GitHub repository configuration.\"\"\"\nGITHUB_TOKEN: str\nGITHUB_REPO_OWNER: str\nGITHUB_REPO_NAME: str\nGITHUB_FILE_PATH: str = \"langfuse_prompt.json\"\nGITHUB_BRANCH: str = \"main\"\nREQUIRED_LABEL: str = \"\" # Optional: only sync prompts with this label\nmodel_config = SettingsConfigDict(\nenv_file=\".env\",\nenv_file_encoding=\"utf-8\",\ncase_sensitive=True\n)\nconfig = GitHubSettings()\nclass LangfuseEvent(BaseModel):\n\"\"\"Langfuse webhook event structure.\"\"\"\nid: UUID = Field(description=\"Event identifier\")\ntimestamp: str = Field(description=\"Event timestamp\")\ntype: str = Field(description=\"Event type\")\naction: str = Field(description=\"Performed action\")\nprompt: Dict[str, Any] = Field(description=\"Prompt content\")\nasync def sync(event: LangfuseEvent) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n\"\"\"Synchronize prompt data to GitHub repository.\"\"\"\n# Check if prompt has required label (if specified)\nif config.REQUIRED_LABEL:\nprompt_labels = event.prompt.get(\"labels\", [])\nif config.REQUIRED_LABEL not in prompt_labels:\nreturn {\"skipped\": f\"Prompt does not have required label '{config.REQUIRED_LABEL}'\"}\napi_endpoint = f\"https://api.github.com/repos/{config.GITHUB_REPO_OWNER}/{config.GITHUB_REPO_NAME}/contents/{config.GITHUB_FILE_PATH}\"\nrequest_headers = {\n\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {config.GITHUB_TOKEN}\",\n\"Accept\": \"application/vnd.github.v3+json\"\n}\ncontent_json = json.dumps(event.prompt, indent=2)\nencoded_content = base64.b64encode(content_json.encode(\"utf-8\")).decode(\"utf-8\")\nname = event.prompt.get(\"name\", \"unnamed\")\nversion = event.prompt.get(\"version\", \"unknown\")\nmessage = f\"{event.action}: {name} v{version}\"\npayload = {\n\"message\": message,\n\"content\": encoded_content,\n\"branch\": config.GITHUB_BRANCH\n}\nasync with httpx.AsyncClient() as http_client:\ntry:\nexisting = await http_client.get(api_endpoint, headers=request_headers, params={\"ref\": config.GITHUB_BRANCH})\nif existing.status_code == 200:\npayload[\"sha\"] = existing.json().get(\"sha\")\nexcept Exception:\npass\ntry:\nresponse = await http_client.put(api_endpoint, headers=request_headers, json=payload)\nresponse.raise_for_status()\nreturn response.json()\nexcept Exception as e:\nraise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f\"Repository sync failed: {str(e)}\")\napp = FastAPI(title=\"Langfuse GitHub Sync\", version=\"1.0\")\n@app.post(\"/webhook/prompt\", status_code=201)\nasync def receive_webhook(event: LangfuseEvent = Body(...)):\n\"\"\"Process Langfuse webhook and sync to GitHub.\"\"\"\nresult = await sync(event)\nreturn {\n\"status\": \"synced\",\n\"commit_info\": result.get(\"commit\", {}),\n\"file_info\": result.get(\"content\", {})\n}\n@app.get(\"/status\")\nasync def health_status():\n\"\"\"Service health check.\"\"\"\nreturn {\"healthy\": True}\nThe server validates webhook payloads, retrieves existing file SHAs if needed, and commits prompt changes to GitHub with descriptive commit messages.\nDependencies\nInstall dependencies:\npip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic-settings httpx\nRunning Locally\nRun locally:\nuvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000\nTest the health endpoint at http://localhost:8000/health\n. Use ngrok or similar to expose localhost for webhook testing.\nStep 4: Deploy and Connect the Server\n-\nDeploy: Use Render, Fly.io, Heroku, or similar. Set environment variables and ensure HTTPS is enabled.\n-\nUpdate Webhook: In Langfuse, edit your webhook and set the URL to\nhttps://your-domain.com/webhook/prompt\n. -\nTest: Update a prompt in Langfuse and verify a new commit appears in your GitHub repository.\nSecurity Considerations\n- Verify signatures: Use the signing secret and\nx-langfuse-signature\nheader to validate requests - Limit PAT scope: Use fine-grained tokens restricted to specific repositories\n- Handle retries: The implementation is idempotent - duplicate events won\u2019t create conflicting commits", "links": [{"href":

The Langfuse Prompt Management is highly available due to multiple caching layers and we closely monitor its performance (status page). However, if you require 100% availability, you can use the following options.\nThe Langfuse API has high uptime and prompts are cached locally in the SDKs to prevent network issues from affecting your application.\nHowever, get_prompt()\n/getPrompt()\nwill throw an exception if:\n- No local (fresh or stale) cached prompt is available -> new application instance fetching prompt for the first time\n- and network request fails -> networking or Langfuse API issue (after retries)\nTo guarantee 100% availability, there are two options:\n- Pre-fetch prompts on application startup and exit the application if the prompt is not available.\n- Provide a\nfallback\nprompt that will be used in these cases.\nOption 1: Pre-fetch prompts\nPre-fetch prompts on application startup and exit the application if the prompt is not available.\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\n# Initialize the Flask app and Langfuse client\napp = Flask(__name__)\nlangfuse = Langfuse()\ndef fetch_prompts_on_startup():\ntry:\n# Fetch and cache the production version of the prompt\nlangfuse.get_prompt(\"movie-critic\")\nexcept Exception as e:\nprint(f\"Failed to fetch prompt on startup: {e}\")\nsys.exit(1) # Exit the application if the prompt is not available\n# Call the function during application startup\nfetch_prompts_on_startup()\n@app.route('/get-movie-prompt/<movie>', methods=['GET'])\ndef get_movie_prompt(movie):\nprompt = langfuse.get_prompt(\"movie-critic\")\ncompiled_prompt = prompt.compile(criticlevel=\"expert\", movie=movie)\nreturn jsonify({\"prompt\": compiled_prompt})\nif __name__ == '__main__':\napp.run(debug=True)\nOption 2: Fallback\nProvide a fallback prompt that will be used in these cases:\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nlangfuse = Langfuse()\n# Get `text` prompt with fallback\nprompt = langfuse.get_prompt(\n\"movie-critic\",\nfallback=\"Do you like {{movie}}?\"\n)\n# Get `chat` prompt with fallback\nchat_prompt = langfuse.get_prompt(\n\"movie-critic-chat\",\ntype=\"chat\",\nfallback=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an expert on

This lets you trigger CI/CD pipelines, sync prompt catalogues, or audit changes without polling the API.\nWhy use webhooks?\n- Production Monitoring: Get alerted when production prompts are updated\n- Team Coordination: Keep everyone informed about prompt changes\n- Syncing: Sync prompt catalogues with other systems\nGet started\nNavigate to Prompts\nand click on Automations\n.\nClick on Create Automation\n.\nSelect events to watch.\nChoose the prompt\u2011version actions that should fire the webhook:\n- Created: a new version is added.\n- Updated: labels or tags change (two events fire: one for the version that gains a label/tag, one for the version that loses it).\n- Deleted: a version is removed.\n(Optional) filter to only trigger on specific prompts.\nConfigure the request\n- URL: HTTPS endpoint that accepts POST requests.\n- Headers: Default headers include:\nContent-Type: application/json\nUser-Agent: Langfuse/1.0\nx-langfuse-signature: <sig>\n(see note on HMAC signature

retry (exponential back\u2011off) until it receives a success response.\nVerify authenticity (recommended)\nEach request carries an HMAC SHA\u2011256 signature in x-langfuse-signature\n.\nRetrieve the

Langfuse", "text": "LLM-as-a-Judge\nLLM-as-a-judge is a technique to evaluate the quality of LLM applications by using an LLM as a judge. The LLM is given a trace or a dataset entry and asked to score and reason about the output. The scores and reasoning are stored as scores in Langfuse.\nWhy use LLM-as-a-judge?\n- Scalable & cost\u2011effective: Judge thousands of outputs quickly and cheaply versus human panels.\n- Human\u2011like judgments: Captures nuance (helpfulness, safety, coherence) better than simple metrics, especially when rubric\u2011guided.\n- Repeatable comparisons: With a fixed rubric, you can rerun the same prompts to get consistent scores and short rationales.\nSet up step-by-step\nCreate a new LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator\nNavigate to the Evaluators page and click on the + Set up Evaluator\nbutton.\nSet the default model\nNext, you\u2019ll define the default model used for conducting the evaluations. The default is used by every managed evaluator; custom templates may override it.\nThis step requires an LLM Connection to be set up. Please see LLM Connections for more information.\n- Setup: This default model needs to be set up once, though it can be changed at any point if needed.\n- Change: Existing evaluators keep evaluating with the new model\u2014historic results stay preserved.\n- Additional Provider Options: You can pass additional parameters when invoking a model. Read this documentation about additional provider options for more information.\n- Structured Output Support: It\u2019s crucial that the chosen default model supports structured output. This is essential for our system to correctly interpret the evaluation results from the LLM judge.\nPick an Evaluator\nNow we select an evaluator. There are two main ways:\nLangfuse ships a growing catalog of evaluators built and maintained by us and partners like Ragas. Each evaluator captures best-practice evaluation prompts for a specific quality dimension\u2014e.g. Hallucination, Context-Relevance, Toxicity, Helpfulness.\n- Ready to use: no prompt writing required.\n- Continuously expanded: by adding OSS partner-maintained evaluators and more evaluator types in the future (e.g. regex-based).\nChoose which Data to Evaluate\nWith your evaluator and model selected, you now specify which data to run the evaluations on. You can chose between running on production tracing data or Datasets during Dataset Runs.\nEvaluating live production traffic allows you to monitor the performance of your LLM application in real-time.\n- Scope: Choose whether to run on new traces only and/or existing traces once (for backfilling). When in doubt, we recommend running on new traces.\n- Filter: Narrow down the evaluation to a specific subset of data you\u2019re interested in. You can filter by trace name, tags,\nuserId\nand may more. Combine filters freely. - Preview: Langfuse shows a sample of traces from the last 24 hours that match your current filters, allowing you to sanity-check your selection.\n- Sampling: To manage costs and evaluation throughput, you can configure the evaluator to run on a percentage (e.g., 5%) of the matched traces.\nMap Variables & preview Evaluation Prompt\nYou now need to teach Langfuse which properties of your trace or dataset item represent the actual data to populate these variables for a sensible evaluation. For instance, you might map your system\u2019s logged trace input to the prompt\u2019s {{input}}\nvariable, and the LLM response ie trace output to the prompt\u2019s {{output}}\nvariable. This mapping is crucial for ensuring the evaluation is sensible and relevant.\n- Prompt Preview: As you configure the mapping, Langfuse shows a live preview of the evaluation prompt populated with actual data. This preview uses historical traces from the last 24 hours that matched your filters (from Step 3). You can navigate through several example traces to see how their respective data fills the prompt, helping you build confidence that the mapping is correct.\n- JSONPath: If the data is nested (e.g., within a JSON object), you can use a JSONPath expression (like\n$.choices[0].message.content\n) to precisely locate it.\n\u2728 Done! You have successfully set up an evaluator which will run on your data.\nNeed custom logic? Use the SDK instead\u2014see Custom Scores or an external pipeline example.\nMonitor & Iterate\nAs our system evaluates your data it writes the results as scores. You can then:\n- View Logs: Check detailed logs for each evaluation, including status, any retry errors. (Tracing the request/response bodies sent to the evaluation model is on our roadmap: https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/7166).\n- Use Dashboards: Aggregate scores over time, filter by version or environment, and track the performance of your LLM application.\n- Take Actions: Pause, resume, or delete an evaluator.", "links": [{"href":

"text": "Human Annotation\nHuman Annotation is a manual evaluation method. It is used to collaboratively annotate traces, sessions and observations with scores.\nIn Langfuse you can use Annotation Queues to streamline working through reviewing larger batches of of single interactions (trace-level), multiple interactions (session-level) or even single observations, below the trace level.\nWhy use Human Annotation?\n- Collaboration: Enable team collaboration by inviting other internal members to annotate a subset of traces and observations. This manual evaluation can enhance the overall accuracy and reliability of your results by incorporating diverse perspectives and expertise.\n- Annotation data consistency: Create score configurations for annotation workflows to ensure that all team members are using standardized scoring criteria. Hereby configure categorical, numerical or binary score types to capture different aspects of your data.\n- Evaluation of new product features: This feature can be useful for new use cases where no other scores have been allocated yet.\n- Benchmarking of other scores: Establish a human baseline score that can be used as a benchmark to compare and evaluate other scores. This can provide a clear standard of reference and enhance the objectivity of your performance evaluations.\nAnnotation of Single Traces, Sessions and Observations\nHuman Annotation of single traces, sessions and observations is available in the trace, session and observation detail view.\nPrerequisite: Create a Score Config\nTo use Human Annotation, you need to have at least one score configuration (Score Config) set up. See how to create and manage Score Configs for details.\nTrigger Annotation on a Trace, Session or Observation\nOn a Trace, Session or Observation detail view click on Annotate\nto open the annotation form.\nSelect Score Configs to use\nSet Score values\nSee newly added Scores\nTo see your newly added scores on traces or observations, click on the Scores\ntab on the trace or observation detail view.\nTo see your newly added scores on sessions, click on the Scores\ntab on the session detail view.\nAll scores are also available in the traces, sessions and observations table views respectively.\nAnnotation Queues\nAnnotation queues allow you to manage and prioritize your annotation tasks in a structured way. This feature is particularly useful for large-scale projects that benefit of human-in-the-loop evaluation at some scale. Queues streamline this process by allowing for specifying which traces, sessions or observations you\u2019d like to annotate on which dimensions.\nCreate Annotation Queues\nPrerequisite: Create a Score Config\nTo use Human Annotation, you need to have at least one score configuration (Score Config) set up. See how to create and manage Score Configs for details.\nGo to Annotation Queues View\n- Navigate to\nYour Project\n>Human Annotation\nto see all your annotation queues. - Click on\nNew queue\nto create a new queue.\nFill out Create Queue Form\n- Select the\nScore Configs\nyou want to use for this queue. - Set the\nQueue name\nandDescription\n(optional).\n- Click on\nCreate queue\nto create the queue.\nAssign Users to Annotation Queues\nGo to Annotation Queues View\n- Navigate to\nYour Project\n>Human Annotation\nto see all your annotation queues. - Click on\nNew queue\nto assign users to a new queue or click the three dots on the right of an existing queue to assign users to it.\nAssign Users to the Queue\n- Expand the\nUser Assignment\nsection under theAdvanced settings\nsection. - Search for the users you want to assign to the queue.\n- Click on the user to assign them to the queue. You can also assign multiple users at once by selecting them in the search results.\n- Review the users you have selected to be assigned to the queue.\n- Click on\nSave\nto save the queue.\nManage Assignments\n- Click on the three dots on the right of the queue or the\nEdit queue\nbutton in the queue detail view to manage the assignments. - View the users assigned to the queue by expanding the\nUser Assignment\nsection. - Assign new users by clicking the\nAssign users\nbutton and searching for the users you want to assign. - Unassign current users by clicking the\nX\nicon on the right of the user.\nRun Annotation Queues\nPopulate Annotation Queues\nOnce you have created annotation queues, you can assign traces, sessions or observations to them.\nTo add multiple traces, sessions or observations to a queue:\n- Navigate to the respective table view and optionally adjust the filters\n- Select Traces, Sessions or Observations via the checkboxes.\n- Click on the \u201cActions\u201d dropdown menu\n- Click on\nAdd to queue\nto add the selected traces, sessions or observations to the queue. - Select the queue you want to add the traces, sessions or observations to.\nNavigate to Annotation Queue\n- Navigate to\nYour Project\n>Human Annotation\n- Option 1: Click on the queue name to view the associated annotation tasks\n- Option 2: Click on \u201cProcess queue\u201d to start processing the queue\nProcess Annotation Tasks\nYou will see an annotation task for each item in the queue.\n- On the\nAnnotate\nCard add scores on the defined dimensions - Click on\nComplete + next\nto move to the next annotation task or finish the queue\nManage Annotation Queues via API\nYou can enqueue, manage and dequeue annotation tasks via the API. This allows for scaling and automating your annotation workflows.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192 Langfuse

Scores - Langfuse", "text": "Custom Scores\nCustom Scores are the most flexible way to implement evaluation workflows using Langfuse. As any other evaluation method the purpose of custom scores is to assign evaluations metrics to Traces\n, Observations\n, Sessions\n, or DatasetRuns\nvia the Score\nobject (see Scores Data Model).\nThis is achieved by ingesting scores via the Langfuse SDKs or API.\nCommon Use Cases\n-\nCollecting user feedback: collect in-app feedback from your users on application quality or performance. Can be captured in the frontend via our Browser SDK. -> Example Notebook\n-\nCustom evaluation data pipeline: continuously monitor the quality by fetching traces from Langfuse, running custom evaluations, and ingesting scores back into Langfuse. -> Example Notebook\n-\nGuardrails and security checks: check if output contains a certain keyword, adheres to a specified structure/format or if the output is longer than a certain length. -> Example Notebook\n-\nCustom internal workflow tooling: build custom internal tooling that helps you manage human-in-the-loop workflows. Ingest scores back into Langfuse, optionally following your custom schema by referencing a config.\n-\nCustom run-time evaluations: e.g. track whether the generated SQL code actually worked, or if the structured output was valid JSON.\nIngesting Scores via API/SDKs\nYou can add scores via the Langfuse SDKs or API. Scores can take one of three data types: Numeric, Categorical or Boolean.\nIf a score is ingested manually using a trace_id\nto link the score to a trace, it is not necessary to wait until the trace has been created. The score will show up in the scores table and will be linked to the trace once the trace with the same trace_id\nis created.\nHere are examples by Score\ndata types\nNumeric score values must be provided as float.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Method 1: Score via low-level method\nlangfuse.create_score(\nname=\"correctness\",\nvalue=0.9,\ntrace_id=\"trace_id_here\",\nobservation_id=\"observation_id_here\", # optional\nsession_id=\"session_id_here\", # optional, Id of the session the score relates to\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\", # optional, inferred if not provided\ncomment=\"Factually correct\", # optional\n)\n# Method 2: Score current span/generation (within context)\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"my-operation\") as span:\n# Score the current span\nspan.score(\nname=\"correctness\",\nvalue=0.9,\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\",\ncomment=\"Factually correct\"\n)\n# Score the trace\nspan.score_trace(\nname=\"overall_quality\",\nvalue=0.95,\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\"\n)\n# Method 3: Score via the current context\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"my-operation\"):\n# Score the current span\nlangfuse.score_current_span(\nname=\"correctness\",\nvalue=0.9,\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\",\ncomment=\"Factually correct\"\n)\n# Score the trace\nlangfuse.score_current_trace(\nname=\"overall_quality\",\nvalue=0.95,\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\"\n)\n\u2192 More details in Python SDK docs and JS/TS SDK docs. See API reference for more details on POST/GET score configs endpoints.\nPreventing Duplicate Scores\nBy default, Langfuse allows for multiple scores of the same name\non the same trace. This is useful if you\u2019d like to track the evolution of a score over time or if e.g. you\u2019ve received multiple user feedback scores on the same trace.\nIn some cases, you want to prevent this behavior or update an existing score. This can be achieved by creating an idempotency key on the score and add this as an id\nwhen creating the score, e.g. <trace_id>-<score_name>\n.\nEnforcing a Score Config\nScore configs are helpful when you want to standardize your scores for future analysis.\n[Image placeholder: Score config creation in Langfuse UI]\nTo enforce a score config, you can provide a configId\nwhen creating a score to reference a ScoreConfig\nthat was previously created. Score Configs\ncan be defined in the Langfuse UI or via our API. See our guide on how to create and manage score configs.\nWhenever you provide a ScoreConfig\n, the score data will be validated against the config. The following rules apply:\n- Score Name: Must equal the config\u2019s name\n- Score Data Type: When provided, must match the config\u2019s data type\n- Score Value when Type is numeric: Value must be within the min and max values defined in the config (if provided, min and max are optional and otherwise are assumed as -\u221e and +\u221e respectively)\n- Score Value when Type is categorical: Value must map to one of the categories defined in the config\n- Score Value when Type is boolean: Value must equal\n0\nor1\nWhen ingesting numeric scores, you can provide the value as a float. If you provide a configId, the score value will be validated against the config\u2019s numeric range, which might be defined by a minimum and/or maximum value.\nfrom langfuse import get_client\nlangfuse = get_client()\n# Method 1: Score via low-level method\nlangfuse.create_score(\ntrace_id=\"trace_id_here\",\nobservation_id=\"observation_id_here\", # optional\nsession_id=\"session_id_here\", # optional, Id of the session the score relates to\nname=\"accuracy\",\nvalue=0.9,\ncomment=\"Factually correct\", # optional\nscore_id=\"unique_id\", # optional, can be used as an idempotency key to update the score subsequently\nconfig_id=\"78545-6565-3453654-43543\", # optional, to ensure that the score follows a specific min/max value range\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\" # optional, possibly inferred\n)\n# Method 2: Score within context\nwith langfuse.start_as_current_span(name=\"my-operation\") as span:\nspan.score(\nname=\"accuracy\",\nvalue=0.9,\ncomment=\"Factually correct\",\nconfig_id=\"78545-6565-3453654-43543\",\ndata_type=\"NUMERIC\"\n)\n\u2192 More details in Python SDK docs and JS/TS SDK docs. See API reference for more details on POST/GET score configs endpoints.\nInferred Score Properties\nCertain score properties might be inferred based on your input:\n- If you don\u2019t provide a score data type it will always be inferred. See tables below for details.\n- For boolean and categorical scores, we will provide the score value in both numerical and string format where possible. The score value format that is not provided as input, i.e. the translated value is referred to as the inferred value in the tables below.\n- On read for boolean scores both numerical and string representations of the score value will be returned, e.g. both 1 and True.\n- For categorical scores, the string representation is always provided and a numerical mapping of the category will be produced only if a\nScoreConfig\nwas provided.\nDetailed Examples:\nFor example, let\u2019s assume you\u2019d like to ingest a numeric score to measure accuracy. We have included a table of possible score ingestion scenarios below.\nUpdate Existing Scores via API/SDKs\nWhen creating a score, you can provide an optional id\nparameter. This will update the score if it already exists within your project.\nIf you want to update a score without needing to fetch the list of existing scores from Langfuse, you can set your own id\nparameter as an idempotency key when initially creating the score.", "links": [{"href": "https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-08-28-typescript-sdk-v4-ga", "anchor": "TypeScript SDK v4 GA \u2192

collection of inputs and expected outputs and is used to test your application. Before executing your first dataset run, you need to create a dataset.\nWhy use datasets?\n- Datasets prerequisite for Dataset Runs, they serve as the data input of Dataset Runs\n- Create test cases for your application with real production traces\n- Collaboratively create and collect dataset items with your team\n- Have a single source of truth for your test data\nGet Started\nCreating a dataset\nDatasets have a name which is unique within a project.\nlangfuse.create_dataset(\nname=\"<dataset_name>\",\n# optional description\ndescription=\"My first dataset\",\n# optional metadata\nmetadata={\n\"author\": \"Alice\",\n\"date\": \"2022-01-01\",\n\"type\": \"benchmark\"\n}\n)\nSee Python SDK docs for details on how to initialize the Python client.\nCreate new dataset items\nDataset items can be added to a dataset by providing the input and optionally the expected output.\nlangfuse.create_dataset_item(\ndataset_name=\"<dataset_name>\",\n# any python object or value, optional\ninput={\n\"text\": \"hello world\"\n},\n# any python object or value, optional\nexpected_output={\n\"text\": \"hello world\"\n},\n# metadata, optional\nmetadata={\n\"model\": \"llama3\",\n}\n)\nSee Python SDK docs for details on how to initialize the Python client.\nCreate synthetic datasets\nFrequently, you want to create synthetic examples to test your application to bootstrap your dataset. LLMs are great at generating these by prompting for common questions/tasks.\nTo get started have a look at this cookbook for examples on how to generate synthetic datasets:\nCreate items from production data\nA common workflow is to select production traces where the application did not perform as expected. Then you let an expert add the expected output to test new versions of your application on the same data.\nlangfuse.create_dataset_item(\ndataset_name=\"<dataset_name>\",\ninput={ \"text\": \"hello world\" },\nexpected_output={ \"text\": \"hello world\" },\n# link to a trace\nsource_trace_id=\"<trace_id>\",\n# optional: link to a specific span, event, or generation\nsource_observation_id=\"<observation_id>\"\n)\nEdit/archive dataset items\nYou can edit or archive dataset items. Archiving items will remove them from future experiment runs.\nYou can upsert items by providing the id\nof the item you want to update.\nlangfuse.create_dataset_item(\nid=\"<item_id>\",\n# example: update status to \"ARCHIVED\"\nstatus=\"ARCHIVED\"\n)\nDataset runs\nOnce you created a dataset, you can test and evaluate your application based on it.", "links": [{"href":
